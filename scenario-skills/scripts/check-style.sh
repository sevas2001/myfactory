# Reporting helper for the em-dash rule. Every rule prints its diagnosis before
# its evidence, and the evidence has to name the offending character: a raw
# grep line that begins with a "- " list bullet reads like the bullet was the
# match, which is how a real em dash on a bulleted line got misdiagnosed as a
# false positive. So each hit is re-emitted as path:line:column with every em
# dash wrapped in >>> <<<.
#
# LC_ALL=C pins awk to byte semantics, so the column is the same number on BSD
# and GNU awk regardless of the caller's locale (an em dash is 3 UTF-8 bytes,
# and a UTF-8-aware awk would otherwise count it as one character). Text before
# an em dash is ASCII in practice, so the byte column is also the character
# column there.

# index()/substr() walk the line instead of gsub() so the em dash is matched
# literally, never as a regular expression.
