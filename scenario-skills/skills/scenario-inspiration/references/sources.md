# Where references actually come from

## Rule zero

A reference informs a prompt. It never ships. Do not reproduce one compositionally, do not drop one into the deliverable as a placeholder to swap later, and never cite a reference you did not actually look at. Take one named mechanic per reference ("pinned silhouette, detail scrolls past it"), not "the vibe".

Describing a living artist's style by name in a prompt is both a rights risk and a moderation risk (see `scenario-moderation`). Name the attributes instead: line weight, palette relationship, edge treatment, value structure. The attributes are what you wanted anyway, and they survive a model switch.

## Lane 1: the team's own assets

The most skipped lane, and usually the best one, because it is already on brand and already licensed. `search` with `target: "assets"` and `public` omitted searches the current project. Run it at both ends of `query_semantic_ratio`: keyword matches the asset's stored text, so 0.8 is what finds a concept that text never spelled out.

Existing collections are prior art. `collections_list`, then `search` with `filters.collection_ids`, tells you what direction this team already chose once.

## Lane 2: the Scenario public catalog

`search` with `public: true` reaches assets published by other teams, and it carries two things a normal image search does not.

- Asset hits include `metadata.prompt`, the wording that produced the image. Read it. A prompt is a better souvenir than a JPEG, because it transfers.
- Model hits (`target: "models"`) included `shortDescription`, `tags`, and `exampleAssetIds` at authoring time. A style model's examples are a finished board for that look, free to browse with `asset_display`, and the model itself is then runnable.

A public asset stays owned by its team. Display it, seed searches with it, read its prompt; to put it on your board you need your own copy (see [moodboard.md](moodboard.md)).

## Lane 3: the open web

Are.na is the closest legitimate equivalent to a public moodboard service: channels are user-curated reference collections, and the API serves them without a key. Fetch a channel the user named, on request. Do not sweep the site, and do not present blocks as licensed assets; a channel is someone's reading list, not a rights clearance.

Text search often beats image search here. Learning that a look is called a specific movement, or that a technique has a name, gives you a query seed that works in every other lane. An image you cannot name is hard to search with; a name is not.

**Pinterest.** Its `robots.txt` allowlists named crawlers and closes with `User-agent: *` / `Disallow: /`, so an agent is disallowed from the whole site. Do not fetch it, do not scrape it, and do not route around it with a mirror or an undocumented feed. Its own API is no help either: the read endpoints are scoped to the authenticated account, so it reaches that user's own boards and nobody else's, and even that needs an approved app. Say all of this plainly and offer the route that works: ask the user to open the board themselves and hand over the images. Unattended, treat the board as a source you cannot reach, run the other lanes, and name it in the handover as the one input nobody supplied. Their board is still the best input in this document; it just arrives through them.

## Lane 4: the user

Ask for three things they already love and one they cannot stand, in any medium. It is the cheapest lane and the highest yield: the seed comes from the person who has to live with the result, and two teams briefing the same agent stop receiving the same answer.

When they name something you cannot see, do not guess. Ask for the file, the URL, or the exact title. Unattended, take these from the task instructions, and when it names none, run the other three lanes and say in the handover that nobody supplied a seed.

## Bringing an outside image in

Anything from lanes 3 and 4 has to become an asset in your project before it can be boarded or used as a reference. Save the file with `curl -L`, which follows the redirects these hosts use, then take the upload and annotation path in [moodboard.md](moodboard.md).

Keep the source URL in the asset's description as you go. A board whose references cannot be traced back is unusable the moment someone asks where an image came from, and for a CC-licensed source the attribution string is part of the trace.
