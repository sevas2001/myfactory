# ZBrush retopology and export (pipeline sculptor)

Expert level means the sculpt leaves ZBrush as a light, clean exchange mesh at its lowest level, detail kept on a rebuilt subdivision stack or in maps, at real size, every file proved by parsing it. Most of it is deterministic palette work an agent does well; click-by-click topology, modifier clicks and a few dialogs stay with a human or computer-use agent. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-zbrush-expert (bridge, stroke engine, review loop, 2026 traps).

Toolkit: [`scripts/zb_retopology_export.py`](scripts/zb_retopology_export.py) (`rx`) on top of the lead's `zb_ops`, `zb_audit` and `zb_launch`: `rx.zcall("func", ...)` inside ZBrush, audits on the agent side. Every projection pass is the lead's safe `zb_ops.project_all` (versioned checkpoint, nets, gate). Not yet run in ZBrush (88 offline tests pass; live tests in [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md)).

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Set symmetry on purpose before every ZRemesher run.** With symmetry on, ZRemesher remeshes half and mirrors it: a silent Mirror And Weld that ruins posed or asymmetric meshes (Drust, Kjce71jjWJU 00:01:11). `rx.zremesh` makes `symmetric` a required argument.
- **Give ZRemesher an easy problem.** A face that will animate goes in neutral, folds relaxed, the expression sculpted back on the new topology (Pavlovich n5_cZK-9peg 00:01:39). Ears and hands are remeshed alone, open borders polished first (00:44:36). Unintended holes are closed first: they survive and inflate the count (ZRemesher doc).
- **ZRemesher is for flow; detail comes back by projection.** Aim low (Gaboury: 5k to 18k for an arm, 34D6VljTjBs 00:02:18), then Project All with Dist 0.1, which fixes "90 percent" of artifacts (Drust nxMYYsyJt3o 00:02:19). Only source and target visible, even in Solo (Pavlovich 01:07:26). With Adapt on and Keep Groups, Target 5 gave 8.0k to 9.4k points (frames 00:18:50, 00:22:09); Adapt off hits the count.
- **Projection has danger zones:** eyes, mouth, armpits, between fingers, crotch; what is left there becomes hard lines in displacement (FlippedNormals Zp07GW3rND0 00:07:43). Mask an eye-interior group grown just past the lid; repair with the morph target or a masked reprojection, never smoothing (00:05:31, 00:06:36).
- **Steer with polygroups, borders smoothed first**: ZRemesher builds jagged borders into the loops (Pavlovich 00:05:27). Smooth Groups 0 on clean borders, 1 for ragged DynaMesh groups (Drust 8D-xqasgUws 00:02:17). Failed eyelids, mouth corners and nostrils are deleted and rebuilt (Pavlovich 00:21:36); the Retopo brush's "No" answer makes a light ZRemesher mesh editable (Pablo Munoz Gomez, I4nePXDTrhQ 00:06:36).
- **The lowest level is the exchange mesh.** UVs are made there (Gaboury cemmalvugFk 00:00:51). Maps compare the current level with the top of the same SubTool, never two SubTools (Drust n0qqpwvn-jA 00:01:14); level 1 carries forms, max-1 micro detail only (2zDAtaQqwh8 00:02:53).
- **Film displacement is a fixed recipe** (FlippedNormals -ThBTEc8L_M): Flip V on ("an absolute must"), Adaptive off (100 UDIMs in about 1 h, not 24 h), DpSubPix 0, 32-bit EXR, 3 Channels off, renderer zero value = Mid (MME doc: Mid 0 for 32-bit; FlippedNormals keep 0.5; record it).
- **Exported size = internal extent x Export Scale** (Drust n2xPrwI9o1U 00:04:19). Keep XYZ Size between 1 and 4 (Gallagher EXjfH_X2hkM 00:28:23). Export Scale and offsets live per SubTool, so the same values go on every SubTool [added].
- **A generated or scanned mesh is a form reference, not topology to repair.** DynaMesh early, after thickening thin shells, which DynaMesh's hole fill "shoots straight across" (Drust PrFQXjs_6_w 00:02:53). Rebuild the stack from the cleaned DynaMesh, never the noisy original [added].

## Workflow

1. **Preflight, checkpoint.** `rx.zcall("preflight", 180.0)`; `zb_ops.save_ztl`. GATE: flags resolved (over 8M vertices, XYZ Size outside 1 to 4, Export Scale 0, duplicate names).
2. **ZRemesher input.** `remesh_input("auto", max_points=2_000_000)` duplicates the sculpt and hides the original (the projection source); `fill_holes=True` adds Close Holes and Fix Mesh when holes are unintended. DynaMesh and Close Holes also shut eye sockets and mouth bags: `openings_closed` sets the hole gate (0, else the intended openings). GATE: copy under 8M vertices, source intact, face neutral.
3. **Guides.** Polygroups by buttons (Auto Groups, Groups By Normals, From Polypaint); a mask a human drew becomes a group with support loops through Edgeloop Masked Border (Drust IpTYcGxxsdM 00:05:08); `polish_band("groups")`. Ears and hands: own SubTools (Groups Split, Split Hidden), `polish_band("border")`, own runs (hand Adaptive Size about 14: Pavlovich 00:59:42), then `merge_down_run(..., weld=True)`; Freeze Border only where borders must re-weld exactly, after remeshing the whole limb, at a cost to animation (01:03:44). GATE: Polyframe sheet shows closed, smooth rings; no seam loops after the re-join.
4. **ZRemesher.** `zremesh(target_k, symmetric, keep_groups=True, smooth_groups=0)` (Half, Same, Double off), then `retry(adaptive_size=...)` over 0, 5, 21. Keep Groups, Keep Creases, Smooth Groups or a sculpt break the Retry cache. The sweep leaves the LAST variant: `pick_retry`, `retry(**pick["retry"])`, `confirm_retry`. Optional Half pass with Adapt off, or a retopology over the retopology (Drust R2MzFqWMaWY 00:01:44). Poor center line at nape or brow: Alt+ZRemesher, a modifier click `press` cannot send: ask computer use, compare `centre_line_components` (Pavlovich 00:48:31). When `snap_back` is true, `project_stack(copy, source, levels=0, checkpoint=ztl)` before judging (00:22:05). GATE: `in_band`; `topo_report` + `retopo_verdict(purpose="rig", expected_holes=...)` on a Grp-on QA export; loops follow forms. Failed orifices: the script stops for a human Retopo pass.
5. **Rebuild the stack.** `project_stack(target, source, checkpoint=ztl)`: two visible, Dist 0.1, level 1 then Divide + Project All per level up to half the source count, a morph target per pass, color last with Colorize on for both SubTools (Drust PrFQXjs_6_w 00:16:35). Danger zones or a film face: `order="top_first", stop_after="nets"` (divisions, then StoreMT and a layer at the top: FlippedNormals 00:02:13), a human isolates the eye-interior group, `protect_isolated(grow=1)`, `project_levels(..., nets_done=True)`. GATE: `projection_from_stack` (level 1 unchanged, bbox 0.5 percent, volume 2 percent [added]); same-view sheet plus danger-zone close-ups per level. Busted areas: `zb_ops.morph_repair`; a target inside the source: masked Inflate, or ProjectionShell with Inner and Dist 1 (Gaboury pQbPtH0p5Bg 00:02:30). Then `drop_morph_target()`: bakes refuse a stored morph target, a possible map base (Drust 2zDAtaQqwh8 00:01:44) [verify].
6. **UVs at level 1** (they carry through the levels, Gaboury cemmalvugFk 00:03:30). Quick: `zb_ops.uv_unwrap("native")`. Explicit seams: `unwrap_creases()` (Pavlovich cvqoVUX5aBw). Painter islands: `uvmaster_roundtrip()`. Eyes get their own simple UVs. GATE: `uv_verdict` on the Txr export; seams hidden, face uncut.
7. **Maps.** `mme_create_all(dir, name, settings="arnold")` or `bake_normal_map` / `bake_displacement_map`. GATE: `map_verdict` per file (size, bits, flat at Mid, normal flat at 128/128/255: Polycount); orientation calibrated once per build (live_rx_04 fixture).
8. **Scale, names, export.** `set_export_scale(180, axis=1)` (every SubTool); `set_export_switches(quads=True, uvs=True, groups=False)`; `export_subtools(dir, level="lowest")`. FBX: ZScript could not suppress its options window, Python is unverified (Maxon forum), AppleScript System Events clicks ZBrush dialogs on this Mac [verify for it]; default: OBJ, converted by scenario-maya-expert or scenario-blender-expert. GATE: `obj_header` reads the Export Scale back from `#Auto scale` (written by 2026.2.1, lead v03 export); `scale_report` passes (1 percent, feet at 0, centered).
9. **Handoff.** `handoff_report(json, ...)`: meshes, maps, unit, axis, Mid and scale, normal convention, audits, sheets, not-verified list.

### Generated or scanned mesh (Z6)

1. GLB from scenario-3d: `glb_to_obj`, `triage_ai_mesh(obj, expected_parts)`, then `orient_for_import`: it rotates only a Z-up hint, centers only an off-center mesh (glTF is Y-up) and names the file to import.
2. `import_mesh` (Weld; Tri2Quad rebuilds quads from AI triangles [verify range]); raw ZTL; `duplicate_keep()`: the copy is the form and color source, tracked by name (`index_of`), since splits and merges renumber SubTools.
3. `fix_mesh`; `split_parts`, `hide_small_parts(protect_names=[raw])`. Fused parts of different colors: `color_to_groups`, Groups Split [added]; else scenario-3d segmentation or human SliceCurve cuts.
4. `close_holes` per part. Swiss cheese after DynaMesh means too thin: thicken first.
5. `merge_down_run` the parts of one body inside the Tool (Drust 00:09:27). `dynamesh_keep(res, keep="groups")`: with polypaint on, DynaMesh keeps paint INSTEAD of polygroups (DynaMesh doc; general rule: scenario-zbrush-sculpting). Blur 0, Project off. Residual holes: `hole_plugs(obj)` on an export, `plug_hole(center, diameter)`, `merge_into(body, [plug])`, re-DynaMesh (Drust PrFQXjs_6_w 00:07:16). Polish; Mirror And Weld if symmetric. Local rebuilds: Sculptris Pro (scenario-zbrush-sculpting).
6. GATE: `cleanup_verdict(raw, clean)` (closed, manifold, shells, bbox 2 percent, roughness at most 0.8x raw [added]); MatCap Gray sheet, Double on, Colorize off for the sheet only (`set_display` returns the old value).
7. ZRemesher per part (5 to 20 thousand), snap back, project geometry from the cleaned DynaMesh, then color only from the raw copy: `project_levels(..., geometry=False, color_last=True)` [verify]. Hand to scenario-zbrush-sculpting (big changes at SDiv 1, secondary at 2 to 3).

## Quality gates

- Code, on every exported file: `topo_report`, `projection_verdict`, `uv_report`, `scale_report`, `map_verdict`, `names_report`, `cleanup_verdict`.
- Visual (`zb_review.review` sheets): Polyframe front, side and three-quarter for loops; source and target at one view after projection, plus danger-zone close-ups at every level; MatCap Gray with Double on for cleanup. Judge with [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md).

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from scenario-zbrush-sculpting, scenario-zbrush-character-creature, scenario-zbrush-stylized, scenario-zbrush-hard-surface: a versioned ZTL with named SubTools, `stats()` and the last sheet; from scenario-3d: GLB or OBJ.
- **Delivers** to scenario-maya-retopology-uv and scenario-maya-rigging: level-1 OBJ per SubTool, cm, Y-up, centered, feet at 0, eyes separate; to scenario-maya-lookdev: maps plus `handoff_report`; to scenario-blender-uv-baking or Substance: low and decimated high with matching names; to scenario-zbrush-paint-render: the stack with UVs; to scenario-zbrush-pose-print: a closed copy.

## ZBrush 2026 notes

- Retopo brushes (2026.1); UV Master with Polygroups fixed in 2026.2.0; Substance Bridge (2026.2) labels "Auto-Bake", "Force Auto-Unwrap" [uistr]: Force Auto-Unwrap is global and strips good UVs.
- SDK: `press()` takes no modifier (Alt-clicks go to computer use); `create_normal_map()` defaults to world space.
- macOS: Control+W makes a polygroup; Command+W quits ZBrush (version deltas 3.13).
- A partial ZRemesh with Freeze Border deletes the subdivision levels (Drust 0TlG4Ex9lQA 00:02:26): `freeze_levels()` around it.
