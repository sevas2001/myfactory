ZRemesher control (0TlG4Ex9lQA, 8D-xqasgUws, IpTYcGxxsdM, Kjce71jjWJU, N1WABlp45ts):

- ZRemesher silently obeys the scene state: only visible polygons are remeshed, and with symmetry on it remeshes half and mirrors it, "an implicit Mirror and Weld" [Kjce71jjWJU 00:01:11 to 00:02:07]. The posed Earthquake came out with both arms matching. Check symmetry before every run on posed, scanned or asymmetric input.
- Polygroups are his preferred steering, over guide curves: "exactly the process I usually prefer" [IpTYcGxxsdM 00:04:02]. Clean borders come from Slice Curve or Edgeloop Masked Border (a mask becomes a group with support loops) [IpTYcGxxsdM 00:05:08].
- Keep Groups hides a Smooth Groups slider at 1 that rounds group borders; 0 holds them exactly, 1 is right for ragged DynaMesh groups [8D-xqasgUws 00:02:17 to 00:03:25].
- Curves from groups: Stroke > Curve Functions with Border and Creased off, Polygroups on, Frame Mesh, then Keep Groups OFF and Curve Strength 100 [8D-xqasgUws 00:03:41]. Curve Strength 50 is the default; 100 puts loops on the curves [IpTYcGxxsdM 00:02:56].
- Iterate: aim low (Target 1, about 1,000 polygons, on a head), then Half, then fix the few badly served features by hand rather than raising the count [N1WABlp45ts 00:01:25 to 00:02:32].
- Partial remesh: hide all but the region, Freeze Border on, ZRemesher: the patch connects cleanly, but the subdivision levels are removed [0TlG4Ex9lQA 00:01:51, 00:02:26].

Reprojection (R2MzFqWMaWY, _ips3GhWI0s, nxMYYsyJt3o, NrsuP4Vj4Lg):

- Duplicate, ZRemesh the copy, divide once, Project All with only the two visible, repeat per level until the top is near the source count [R2MzFqWMaWY 00:02:16 to 00:03:52; _ips3GhWI0s 00:04:53].
- Dist 0.1: "usually 90% of the time just changing this distance slider here to 0.1 ... will often give you the result" [nxMYYsyJt3o 00:02:19].
- StoreMT before projecting; remaining spikes mean the target sits under the source. Morph-brush them back, raise the target with a big ClayBuildup until it engulfs the source, reproject, or reproject masked areas only (faster) [nxMYYsyJt3o 00:02:52 to 00:07:11].
- Geometry first, polypaint only at the last level with polypaint enabled on the target; answer No to the "no polypaint" note on geometry passes [_ips3GhWI0s 00:05:25 to 00:06:29].
- Decimation gives triangles for print and bake files, never rig-ready quads [_ips3GhWI0s 00:00:35]. The level-1 ZRemesher mesh is also where UV Master can work [00:07:03].
- Freeze SubDivision Levels at the top level unlocks ZModeler, DynaMesh and ZRemesher on a subdivided sculpt; pressing it again rebuilds and reprojects [NrsuP4Vj4Lg 00:01:17 to 00:02:26].

Maps (n0qqpwvn-jA, 2zDAtaQqwh8, RYGkbSUaHHg, ADIRhNlvXbI):

- ZBrush maps compare the selected level with the highest level of the same SubTool: "you can't have a subtool that is your low resolution version and then a subtool that is your high resolution version" [n0qqpwvn-jA 00:01:14].
- The low level filters the content: level 1 against 6 gives wrinkles and forms, level 5 against 6 only pores and stitching [2zDAtaQqwh8 00:02:53 to 00:04:00].
- Color ID from polygroups needs Unweld Groups Border on low poly meshes, or colors bleed across shared vertices [RYGkbSUaHHg 00:03:24].
- HD Geometry exports only what Sculpt HD preview shows; isolate polygroups first; Duplicate in HD preview converts HD levels to regular levels [ADIRhNlvXbI 00:02:45 to 00:08:52].

Scale (n2xPrwI9o1U, fiIVK6t-2x0, YrD29hiokJo):

- Imports are normalized to XYZ Size 2; the real size moves into Export Scale. Exported value = XYZ Size x Export Scale: 2 x 63.5 = 127 [n2xPrwI9o1U 00:04:19]. Scale = target / XYZ Size: 254 / 3.5 = 72.57 [00:06:37].
- Check in a text editor: read the OBJ vertex coordinates [n2xPrwI9o1U 00:07:45]. The agent parses the file (`scale_report`) and reads ZBrush's `#Auto scale` header line.
- Known-feature sizing: a bar between the pupils at 63 mm, or a 1 inch cube, then resize everything with All on [fiIVK6t-2x0 00:03:27; YrD29hiokJo 00:04:16]. STL carries no unit: tell the printer [YrD29hiokJo 00:05:21].

Decimation (mRfA_WDvvrg): Decimation Master drops polygroups; recover them with Unweld Groups Border, Freeze Borders, decimate, Auto Groups, Weld Points, then divide once to prove it is watertight [00:02:35 to 00:05:04].

Scan and single-sided cleanup (PrFQXjs_6_w, udiPVJIODX0), the closest official recipe to Z6:

- Inspect with MatCap Gray and colorize off; the diffuse hides holes [PrFQXjs_6_w 00:00:09]. Duplicate first: the untouched copy is the projection source for shape and color [00:01:15].
- Try DynaMesh 512, Blur off, Project off. Swiss cheese means the shell is too thin, not a resolution problem: DynaMesh's close-holes "just doesn't have anything else to do but shoot straight across" [00:02:21 to 00:02:53].
- Close Holes, isolate the fill polygroup, push it back to make a volume, DynaMesh again [00:03:26 to 00:07:16]. Plug remaining holes with Unified, embedded PolySpheres, MergeDown, re-DynaMesh [00:07:16 to 00:10:33].
- Junk: group it, hide, Delete Hidden, re-DynaMesh [00:10:33]. Flat base: straight SliceCurve, hide below, Delete Hidden, re-DynaMesh [00:11:39].
- Light working mesh: DynaMesh 128 kept the silhouette at about 50k points; divide to about 3M; Project All Dist 0.1 with colorize on for both [00:14:58 to 00:17:42].
- Texture to geometry: Mask By Intensity, colorize off, Inflate a little [00:19:21]. BumpViewer shows polypaint as bump while sculpting [00:17:42].
- Close Holes is global: fills that must stay open (a fabric edge, the back of a relief) are isolated by polygroup and deleted [udiPVJIODX0 00:04:30].

## Paul Gaboury (Pixologic, then Maxon; #AskZBrush)

- "It's not really going to be possible to remesh with the remesher and maintain high fidelity detail, that's not what its goal is" [34D6VljTjBs 00:00:39]. On a 3M arm: 90k keeps a lot, 18k is "pretty good", 5k still enough [00:01:10 to 00:02:51].
- Project History avoids the duplicate: remesh and divide in place, Ctrl-click the detailed undo state, Project History with Color off [34D6VljTjBs 00:04:20 to 00:05:24]. No SDK call sets the history point, so the agent uses the duplicate route.
- ProjectionShell for wildly different shapes: drag it until only the target color shows (Inner turns on), Dist to the maximum 1, "like a fishing line" [pQbPtH0p5Bg 00:02:30 to 00:03:02].
- UVs belong on the lowest level; UV Master's Work on Clone, Unwrap, Copy UVs, select the original, Paste UVs [cemmalvugFk 00:00:51, 00:04:00 to 00:07:28]. AUV, GUV and PUV tiles fill space but are unreadable for a painter [00:01:25 to 00:03:30].

## Ian Robinson (Maxon; #AskZBrush)

- Decimation Master's Use and Keep Polypaint is off by default; enable it before pre-processing; presets pre-process and decimate in one click [bVX9utHc_ZI 00:01:17, 00:02:15].
- Scale Master: New Bounding Box SubTool, Set Scene Scale, type the size, Resize Subtool with All, Export to Unit Scale [bICt_XruvQM]. The dialogs make it a human route; the agent does the Export Scale arithmetic.

## Michael Pavlovich (games sculptor: Halo 4, Call of Duty, Doom; Maxon ZBrushLIVE host)

Topology, face and body (n5_cZK-9peg, ZBrush 2023):

- ZRemesher gives even quads but not reliable loops at eyes, mouth, nose points and lip corners; past a point "it's easier to just build what I need to rather than trying to finagle ZRemesher" [00:06:00], so delete those regions and rebuild them [00:21:36, 00:22:40].
- Give ZRemesher an easier problem: neutral expression, folds smoothed away, the smile sculpted back later on the new topology [00:01:39 to 00:02:46].
- Concentric polygroup rings around eyes and mouth, most important areas first, then fill the blanks [00:06:32, 00:08:55].
- Smooth the group borders before remeshing, because ZRemesher builds aliased borders into the flow: Shift with Weighted Smooth Mode 6 (Groups Border), or the button route Mask By Feature (Groups), Grow Mask, invert, Polish By Features [00:05:27, 00:07:48, 00:15:18]. `rx.polish_band` is the button route.
- Smooth Groups 0 once borders are smooth; the default 1 "melts" the mesh [00:17:08].
- Numbers he read on screen: Target 5, Adaptive Size 0 gave about 8k points, 21 gave 9,397, 5 gave 8,551 (7 s) on a grouped head of 169,089 points [frames 00:18:28 to 00:22:09]. Adaptive Size 0 hits the count and even quads but fails on tight turns [00:17:40, 00:18:13].
- Store a projectable state before any topology change and project back after every ZRemesher, Smooth Groups, density or smoothing pass: they all shrink the surface [00:03:31, 00:22:05, 01:03:12]. `rx.zremesh` returns the shrink ratio.
- Ears and hands remeshed as separate SubTools, their open borders polished first (Mask By Feature Border, Grow, invert, Polish By Features open circle), stitched back where deformation is low [00:44:36 to 00:47:31].
- Freeze Border re-welds separately remeshed parts exactly, "probably not great for animation" [01:03:44 to 01:04:17]. [added] Remesh the whole limb to the wanted density first, then split and Freeze Border, or the frozen border keeps a dense DynaMesh ring.
- Polypaint density read on screen: white = 1 (neutral), Color Density 2 picks pink for more polygons, 0.25 light blue for fewer; Colorize on to see it; start from a white fill [01:01:32 to 01:02:38]. This settles the ZRemesher doc's contradictory paragraphs.
- Groups place loops, polypaint sets density: the arm went from 11,384 to 2,780 points with 2x density on the hand [frames 01:02:44, 01:03:29].
- Alt+ZRemesher switches the midline algorithm; compare nape and brow at low targets (1k, 1.5k) with a snapshot [00:48:31, 00:49:05].
- Project All reads every SubTool whose eye is on, even in Solo mode [01:07:26]. Project History needs no second SubTool [01:08:33].
- DynaMesh and color (Masking Basics, 8kWFv1cZlCE, `notes/sculpting/`): his polypaint was lost because he re-DynaMeshed without Colorize on [00:20:06]. The DynaMesh doc states the other half: with polypaint on, DynaMesh keeps polypaint INSTEAD of polygroups ("PolyGroups > Important"). On an AI or scan mesh the choice is made on purpose: `dynamesh_keep(keep="groups")` keeps the part groups, and color returns by projection from the raw copy. scenario-zbrush-sculpting owns the general rule.
- Materials (aR02CwyPTUw, `notes/sculpting/`): MatCaps bake their lighting; to judge whether forms read under changing light, use a Standard material and move the light front, side and behind [00:04:07, 00:04:39]; Red Wax "will really enhance differences between your surfaces" [00:03:32]. Used in the cleanup critique.
- Borrowed topology: wrap a base head (DemoHead) with Dynamics shrink-wrap: Gravity off, Contract with C Amount 0.03 (head) or 0.29 (arm), CollisionVolume Resolution 291, Inflate 0, then Project All [00:54:08 to 00:55:14]; Wrap or ZWrap are faster third-party tools [00:52:23].
- Camera-projection brushes (ZProject, HistoryRecall) need a straight-on view and symmetry off [00:57:02, 00:57:33].

UVs with crease seams (cvqoVUX5aBw, ZBrush 2023):

- Auto Seams makes one island with no overlap, fine when only maps matter [00:02:12]. Explicit seams: consolidate polygroups to the islands you want, Crease PG, Unwrap with Crease Edges [00:02:44 to 00:04:23]. Hands pelt-map and tails unwrap into circles until extra seams are creased with ZModeler Crease Shortest Path [00:04:23 to 00:08:11]. "Creases do not cut until you unwrap again" [00:08:11].
- "You generally want to put your UV seams where the camera is not going to see it" [00:06:00].
- Layout edits on a UV Master clone: Gizmo moves of isolated groups with symmetry off; islands outside 0 to 1 are rescaled on the next Flatten [00:08:11 to 00:09:51].

## Pablo Munoz Gomez (ZBrushGuides founder, Maxon ZBrushLIVE presenter, Retopo brush beta tester)

The 2026 Retopo brush (I4nePXDTrhQ, ZBrush 2026.1.1):

- It is "literally just a brush" that combines ZSphere topology, the Topology brush and ZModeler [00:00:38]. Its job: a clean quad mesh when ZRemesher's result is not what you want [00:03:01].
- First click: Yes creates a new retopo SubTool (for a dense sculpt); No converts the current mesh, right for a light ZRemesher result that is "99 percent ready"; No on a dense mesh "is gonna be pretty heavy and it's gonna potentially crash" [00:05:59 to 00:07:09].
- Points project onto every visible SubTool: leave the eyes visible to wrap head and eyes as one mesh [00:08:33].
- "The only thing that you really need to remember when working with this brush is the spacebar": the normal size grabs and moves, the Space size connects points into polygons [00:12:46, 00:05:23].
- Loops first, then fill; smooth (Shift, Smooth Retopo) only at the end [00:16:26, 00:19:13]. Patches (228 bundled) save hours on humanoids; stylized and exaggerated characters are done by hand [00:04:09, 00:29:03].
- "A good topology is just whatever works for whatever you're doing" [00:32:18].
- Pablo also sets the production order behind this skill: topology, UVs and export last (Understanding ZBrush's Logic), and ZRemesher 5 gave 4,963 [rArw79xEpvE 00:03:16].
- Level discipline (Logic Part 7): big changes at SDiv 1, secondary forms at SDiv 2 or 3, then up; moving large forms or detailing only at the top level are two beginner mistakes [rArw79xEpvE 00:12:28 to 00:14:16]. The rebuilt stack is handed over with that rule.
- Projection density (Logic Part 8): the target's top level needs at least the source's point count, "as long as it's more or slightly more than that, we will be able to recover all those details" (745k against a 400k DynaMesh) [VRisbJQAaZw 00:17:24]. Sculptris Pro adds resolution only where a small detail needs it, instead of raising a whole DynaMesh [00:10:41, 00:11:53]: the local-rebuild tool for a damaged region of a cleaned AI mesh.
- MergeVisible creates a NEW tool and leaves the working tool intact; MergeDown merges inside the tool [gitoJ7B8FmY 00:03:31, 00:04:11]. Cleanup merges down (`merge_down_run`, `merge_into`).

## FlippedNormals (Henning Sanden and Morten Jaeger, ex-MPC and ex-Framestore film artists)

ZBrush to Arnold, 32-bit displacement with UDIMs (-ThBTEc8L_M, ZBrush 4R8, Maya 2018):

- A 2M sculpt cannot be rigged; the low mesh plus a displacement map carries the detail [00:03:00]. MME does every SubTool and UDIM unattended [00:04:09].
- Most switches are wrong by default for film: Flip V on ("an absolute must") [00:06:13], Adaptive off ("the quality difference is so negligible"; 100 UDIMs in about 1 h versus 24 h) [00:08:12], DpSubPix 0 [00:08:45], SmoothUV on if the renderer smooths UVs [00:09:52], Mid 0.5 [00:10:01], 32Bit and exr on [00:10:34], 3Channels off [00:11:08], Map Border at maximum [00:05:41], SubDiv level 1 (the level the rig uses) [00:07:40].
- Merge Maps could not output EXR in 2018; they give each object its own UDIM tiles instead [00:04:43, 00:11:08]. Later builds fixed MME merging with UDIMs (2021.7.1) [verify EXR plus Merge Maps on 2026].
- UDIM file names with a dot after the DM suffix so the files form a sequence [00:13:50].
- Switch MT was "currently broken" in 2018 [00:07:09]; the 2026 doc documents it [verify].
- Export the low mesh with Grp off, or Maya splits it [00:15:08].
- Arnold: File node Filter off, UV Tiling Mode UDIM (Mari); Catmull-Clark about 3 iterations; Auto Bump; zero value matched to Mid (the video description corrects the field to Scalar Zero Value) [00:17:29 to 00:20:35].
- "Most times you have issues with displacement ... simply just caused by bad geometry in ZBrush" [00:21:41].

Reprojecting details (Zp07GW3rND0, 2018; `notes/sculpting/`), the production view of Project All:

- Routine work, done "all the time" whenever topology or reduction changes [00:00:03]. Subdivide the new low mesh to "a few million", about 3M [00:01:02].
- Order at the highest level: Store MT, then a New Layer, then Project All: "It's important that you do all of this on the highest level" [00:02:13, 00:02:47]. PA Blur lowered for a clean source. Staged alternative when the shapes differ a lot: step down to level 1 and project upward level by level, fixing gross mismatches low [00:03:17, 00:03:49]. `project_stack(order="top_first")` is this order; the lead's `zb_ops.project_all` sets the same two nets.
- Danger zones: parts that sit close together grab the wrong surface: eyes, mouth, armpits, between the fingers, the crotch [00:01:41, 00:07:10]; artifacts left there become hard lines in displacement maps "down the pipe" [00:07:43].
- Eyes: keep a polygroup inside the eye, grow it to just outside the lid, mask by it, reproject [00:05:31, 00:06:03]. `protect_isolated` is the scripted half; isolating the group is a Ctrl+Shift click.
- Repair with the Morph brush back to the stored target, not smoothing: "you're never gonna be able to smooth these kind of things out properly"; rogue vertices "go to infinity" [00:04:27, 00:06:36]. Local reprojection: mask, invert, project only there [00:09:27].
- Do not take a concept sculpt to final micro detail before retopology: tight areas get destroyed and must be resculpted [00:02:13, 00:08:22]; a proper sculpting pass follows reprojection [00:08:55].

ZBrush to Substance Painter (p56N-dN11zY, 2019):

- For offline work, skip the low poly: Decimation Master 150k with Keep UVs, MergeVisible with UV on, paint the decimated high directly, no normal map [00:00:42 to 00:02:59].
- Polygroups become texture sets (Export Polygroups as Mats) [00:03:46]; smooth normals on export or every baked map inherits faceting [00:06:03].
- ID map from polypaint: MME Texture From Polypaint, SubTools off, Flip V on [00:09:45 to 00:10:51].
- In 2026.2+ the Substance Bridge replaces the manual FBX route for most cases (version deltas); the decisions (UVs kept, polygroups as sets, smooth normals, ID from polypaint) still apply.

## Laura Gallagher (Outgang; former Lead Character Artist at Eidos Montreal, Guerrilla Games)

Units and scale (EXjfH_X2hkM, ZBrush 2021):

- "ZBrush doesn't really have internally a concept of centimeters or inches or meters, it's just units" [00:04:27]. Every primitive fits a 2 x 2 x 2 box [00:07:21].
- Two scale problems: exported size (Tool > Export > Scale) and internal size (XYZ Size about 2) [00:38:11]. Keep internal size "within the same order of amplitude essentially as two": 1 to 4 are fine, 0.1, 10 or 20 are not [00:28:23 to 00:28:55].
- DynaMesh resolution subdivides the scene's unit space, not the object [00:11:41 to 00:14:22].
- Export Scale also drives the transpose-line readout: measure first, export second [00:19:46 to 00:22:27]. Rule of thumb: Export Scale about half the real longest dimension; a 180 cm character reads Export Scale 90 [00:26:16, 00:28:55]. Scale 0 means never set [00:24:03].
- Offsets are internal units: Y Offset 1 stands a 2-unit model on Maya's grid [00:33:04, 00:33:40].
- Unify is fine for simple objects but can "screw up everything" with layers and morph targets; rescale a complex character by Save As then MultiAppend into a correctly scaled tool [00:27:16, 00:38:48 to 00:44:24].
- Relying on Scale Master without understanding the model gets you into trouble [00:45:17].

## Maxon documentation (help.maxon.net, 2026 help)

- ZRemesher: prepare the input (a level that holds the shape, a decimated copy above about 8M vertices, Close Holes, Fix Mesh); Adaptive Size default 50; Adapt off to hit the count; Curve Strength "the higher you set this slider, the fewer Curves you should draw"; Fast Retry keeps its cache for target, Adapt, Keep Polypaint, Detect Edges, Freeze Groups, Freeze Borders, Adaptive Size, curves, Use Polypaint and symmetry, and discards it for any sculpt, Smooth Groups, Keep Creases or Keep Groups change; retopology over retopology improves flow; Legacy mode "has been removed" per the 4.0 page, while the reference page and the 2026.2.1 UI strings still list it.
- Retopo brush (2026.1): manual topology is for deforming areas with prescribed loops; a 100k+ head needs about 10,000 to 20,000 polygons for animation; "A common mistake is creating retopology that's still too dense to be useful"; hide the reference and look for triangles and broken loops.
- Projection and subdivision: Project All works between different topologies "broadly similar in shape", best with only source and target visible; Dist maximum 1; positive ProjectionShell turns Inner on; Close Holes only without levels; Divide adds a level only when nothing is masked or hidden; Reproject Higher Subdiv from three or more levels below the top.
- UV Master: a creator, not an editor: "Seams can be attracted, restricted, but not exactly placed"; 100k to 150k polygons; Work on Clone whenever more than one click; Protect counts from 70 percent intensity; a closed protected ring forces a seam; control maps bind to the Tool name; Flatten cannot make multi-tile UVs.
- Multi Map Exporter: Mid 0.5 for 16-bit, "for 32 bit maps best results are with a setting of 0", Scale 1 for 32-bit; Get Scale and the lower value for 16-bit; Tangent for anything animated; back up before running (ESC can lose UVs); Merge Maps needs equal sizes.
- Decimation Master: options, pre-process, decimate; edits after pre-processing are ignored; masks move polygons, not the count; polygroups are not kept; Keep UVs costs 50 percent more memory; unique SubTool names.
- Export, GoZ, FBX, Substance Bridge: GoZ needs unique names across all loaded Tools and sends the lowest level; FBX axis presets with "If in doubt then MayaYUp"; Substance Bridge Low & High plus Auto-Bake, and "Force UV Auto-Unwrap is a global setting"; Scale Master: "Subtools function best in ZBrush when their XYZ Size is set to 2"; SubTool Master ScaleOffset resets Export Scale and offsets for all SubTools (so they are per-SubTool values).

## Polycount wiki (game-art practitioners)

- Bake from high to low with rays from outside; decimate ZBrush highs first: "Sculpting tools like Zbrush create triangles smaller than the bake pixels" (Baking Workflow 8).
- Triangulate the low poly before baking and keep that triangulation in the engine; split UVs at every hard edge; explode or bake-group intersecting parts; do not rotate or mirror UVs after baking.
- Flat normal color is 128, 128, 255; bake 16-bit, reduce to 8-bit last; re-normalize after edits; displacement needs 16 or 32-bit.
- "It is best to assume all tutorials are incorrect, until you can verify the results yourself": the reason for the live_rx_04 calibration fixture.

## What an agent can and cannot do here [added]

- Deterministic and strong: every ZRemesher option, Retry sweeps, visibility control, projection loops, native and UV Master unwraps, Crease PG seams, MME and Tool palette bakes, Export Scale and offsets, OBJ exports, Decimation Master, Close Holes, Fix Mesh, Split To Parts, MergeVisible, DynaMesh, Polish, Mirror And Weld, Polygroups From Polypaint, Mask By Intensity + Inflate, and every check on the files.
- New since the Z4 and Z6 grades [added]: Retry sweeps that end on the chosen variant (`pick_retry`), level-1 snap-backs, color passes with Colorize on both sides, DynaMesh that keeps groups on purpose, in-Tool merges by name (`merge_into`), plugs placed from the file (`hole_plugs`), masks for danger zones once a zone is isolated (`protect_isolated`).
- Weak or human: ZRemesherGuide curves, lasso and pen masks for face rings, isolating a polygroup (Ctrl+Shift click) before `protect_isolated`, neutralizing an expression (scenario-zbrush-character-creature), Retopo brush gestures and patches, ZModeler Crease Shortest Path and edge fixes, Protect and Attract painting, Transpose pushes (thickening a fill), PolySphere plug placement, Undo History Ctrl-clicks, Alt-clicks (alternative midline), FBX options, GoZ's first app chooser, anything inside Painter.
- The honest report names which of the weak steps the brief needed and who should do them.
