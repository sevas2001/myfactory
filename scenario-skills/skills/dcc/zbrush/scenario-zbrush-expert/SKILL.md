# ZBrush expert (router and agent protocol)

An agent does expert ZBrush work as a loop: deterministic palette operations, synthesized strokes and canvas renders from fixed views, gated at every stage. One long script is not the method. This skill is the protocol every ZBrush task follows, the shared toolkit in [`scripts/`](scripts/), and the map to the team skills. Target: ZBrush 2026.2.1 on macOS, driven through the project's Python bridge. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

| Bridge into a running ZBrush ([`scripts/zb_launch.py`](scripts/zb_launch.py), over the client [`scripts/zb_bridge.py`](scripts/zb_bridge.py)) | all interactive work: palette operations, strokes, renders, measurements | `zb_launch.start()` spawns ZBrush with [`ZBRUSH_PLUGIN_PATH=scripts/zb_plugins`](scripts/zb_plugins/) and `ZB_BRIDGE_AUTOSERVE=1`. It waits for "plugin loaded", the port and a ping, then quits the ZHomePage helper. Work with `zb_launch.run(code)` or `zb_launch.call("zb_ops", "dynamesh", 256)`. End with `zb_launch.stop(save_to=".../x.ztl")`. |
| `-script` batch launch                                                                                                                        | unattended jobs on saved files (export every SubTool, reports)           | `ZBrush.app/Contents/MacOS/ZBrush -script /abs/job.py args /abs/scene.ZPR`: the scene is the LAST argument, script args start at `sys.argv.index("-script") + 2`, report through files and `sys.exit(code)` (Maxon quickstart). Whether ZBrush quits on exit [verify].                                                                                 |

Rules for the bridge:

- **Main thread only.** Every `zbc` call runs in main mode, which is the default of `run` and `call`. The embedded VM keeps the GIL on ZBrush's main thread, so a socket thread alone starves. The proven design is a serve loop on the main thread that calls `update(redraw_ui=True)` between polls (README).
- **One driver.** Only one agent drives ZBrush at a time. ZBrush is single-instance: `start()` refuses a second instance and never kills a ZBrush it did not spawn.
- **Short, measured calls.** Each call returns numbers (faces, volume, file bytes). Long operations such as ZRemesher, Decimation or Divide into millions get minute-scale timeouts. A timeout does not cancel queued code: it still runs when the main thread frees. Ping and read state before sending anything else.
- **No blocking UI.** Never call `message_*`, `ask_*` or `show_note(..., 0)`. For visible progress use `set_notebar_text(text, progress)`.
- **One shared interpreter.** ZBrush keeps one embedded Python for the whole session: what a call leaves behind stays until restart. `run` and `call` leave `sys.path`, `sys.modules`, stdout and the working directory as found and pop every toolkit module, also after an error (Maxon Style Guide; the server runs the restore hook). Never add a folder to `sys.path` for good, never import toolkit code outside `zb_launch.run`. `zb_launch.hygiene()` must return empty lists; `purge()` removes a leak.
- **Long sequences.** Group deterministic steps into one call: [`zb_ops.sequence([["divide", [2]], ["polish", [10]]])`](scripts/zb_ops.py) runs them inside `freeze` with `show_actions(0)`; `quiet()` and `frozen(fn)` are the parts (SDK GUI reference). Never freeze a plugin press or a canvas export; call `update(redraw_ui=True)` before a snapshot.
- **Locked screen.** `Document:Export` still writes the canvas PNG (v03); `screencapture` shows only the lock screen. At 05:30 on 2026-09-24 a launch stalled after the Home Page press, while the 05:20 launch under the same lock worked. `start()` detects the stall, terminates the process it spawned and reports a diagnosis (details in `zb_launch.py`).
- Check `zbrush_info(0)` = 2026.2 before trusting anything below.

## 3. The expert loop in ZBrush

1. **Brief in numbers.** Purpose (film, game, print, concept), polycount per stage, print height in mm, style, references. When the brief is silent, pick the domain skill's documented default and write it down.
2. **Plan big to small.** Block with primitives, ZSpheres or low DynaMesh; then primary, secondary and tertiary forms. Topology, UVs and export come last (Pablo Munoz Gomez's order in _Understanding ZBrush's Logic_).
3. **Build one stage** with deterministic operations first; they are exact and cheap. Use strokes only where the form needs them. Before any stroke: Edit mode on, symmetry state chosen on purpose, brush and Draw values set and read back, view fixed with `set_transform`. Record the volume before and after as evidence that the stroke sculpted.
4. **Gate the stage.**
   - Numbers: `zb_ops.stats()`, plus [`zb_audit.audit()`](scripts/zb_audit.py) on an OBJ export. Every destructive wrapper (DynaMesh, ZRemesher, Divide, Decimate, Polish, Project All) returns a `gate`: volume ratio from `get_polymesh3d_volume()` and watertightness from `is_polymesh3d_solid()`. A collapsed or exploded remesh is a problem, a lost watertight state a warning; `zb_ops.require_gate(r)` raises. Bands are [added] start values.
   - Review sheet: [`zb_review.review(out_dir)`](scripts/zb_review.py) renders front, right, back, three-quarter and top with a neutral MatCap (MatCap Gray) and tiles one labeled sheet (the triples beyond front are [verify live_03]; an upside-down or wrong-side tile is visible on the sheet). Open it with the image reader and judge it with the domain skill's critique. Experts orbit constantly; the sheet is the agent's orbit.
5. **Fix before detail.** A proportion error found at blockout costs one call; found after projection it costs the stage.
6. **Checkpoint before anything destructive.** Save a versioned ZTL before DynaMesh, ZRemesher, Project All, Booleans, merges and Decimation. There is no undo control. `zb_ops.project_all(checkpoint="/abs/x.ztl")` refuses to run without one, since Project All "might crash the program" (cgside). It then stores a morph target and a New Layer at the top level (FlippedNormals), sets Dist 0.1 (Drust) and flags spikes (a vertex outside the visible bbox). Repair with `morph_repair(points)` (Morph brush back to the stored target) or the layer, never by smoothing (FlippedNormals).
7. **Deliver with evidence:** the final sheet, audit numbers, file paths, and what was not verified.

Never report a model as done without having looked at a canvas render of its final state.

## 4. File safety

- Turn Edit mode on before any canvas stroke (`zb_ops.ensure_edit()`). With Edit off, a drag stamps another pixol copy of the tool (Pablo, Logic Part 1).
- Save versioned `.ZTL` files: `zb_ops.save_ztl(path)` picks the next free `_vNNN` and never overwrites. Keep at least three increments; AutoSave alone is not enough (Maxon, Saving Your Work). QuickSave is crash recovery, not versioning.
- Never open a project over unsaved tools. Opening a `.ZPR` deletes every loaded tool (Pavlovich 005). Save each changed tool first. Ctrl+S saves a project, not the model.
- Name SubTools at creation: renaming later needs a text prompt. On save, the top SubTool takes the file name (Pavlovich 030).
- Write only outside the install, which is read-only for ZBrush since 2026.1, and always use absolute paths: relative ones land in the app folder. Exports keep a `.bak` of any file they replace.
- Keep originals. Duplicate before ZRemesher or Decimation (the sculpt stays the projection source). Merge Visible creates a new tool. Store a morph target before a risky stroke pass.
- Do not touch the user's configuration (Store Config, hotkeys, `zbc.config()`, `zbc.reset()`) without consent.

- `zb_ops.py` (inside ZBrush): checked wrappers `new_sphere`, `dynamesh`, `divide`, `del_levels`, `zremesher`, `project_all` (safe: checkpoint, nets, Dist, gate), `top_level`, `store_morph_target`, `new_layer`, `set_layer_intensity`, `morph_repair`, `polish`, `deform`, `mask`, `polygroups`, `visibility`, `uv_unwrap`, `decimate`, `export_obj`, `export_canvas`, `save_ztl`, `select_brush`, `find_brush`, `set_draw`, `set_material`, `set_symmetry`, `sculpt_stroke`, `stats`, `subtools`, `gate`, `require_gate`, `quiet`, `frozen`, `sequence`. `PATHS` lists every item path with its evidence tag.
- `zb_stroke.py` (pure Python, both sides): `encode`/`decode` V02 strings, `line`, `polyline`, `arc`, `zigzag`, `dab`, `resample`, `clip_to_canvas`, `Camera(transform, pivot).project(p)`, `frame_transform`, `visible_mask`, `front_most_vertex`, `fit_convention`, `VIEWS`.
- `zb_review.py`: `review(out_dir, views, matcap)` (agent side), `capture_views` and `snapshot(path)` (inside ZBrush), `contact_sheet`, `silhouette_bbox`.
- `zb_audit.py` (agent side, numpy): `audit(obj)` gives counts, poles, holes, non-manifold, winding, shells, symmetry, bbox, area, volume and edge lengths; `verdict(report, "sculpt"|"game"|"print", ...)`; `displaced(a, b)`.

Offline tests pass (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/code/zbrush-expert -p "test_*.py"`). The ZBrush-side functions have not yet run in ZBrush as functions; the calls under them that v01 to v03 proved are listed in [`references/sdk-cookbook.md`](references/sdk-cookbook.md). `tests/code/zbrush-expert/run_live.sh` runs the live checks in one command.

```python
# not yet run in ZBrush as a sequence
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<this skill>/scripts")
import zb_launch as zl, zb_review, zb_audit
zl.start()
zl.call("zb_ops", "new_sphere", 128)
zl.call("zb_ops", "sculpt_stroke", [[500, 380], [620, 380]], brush="ClayBuildup", size=40,
        z_intensity=25)
sheet = zb_review.review("/abs/out/stage1")["sheet"]          # look at it
obj = zl.call("zb_ops", "export_obj", "/abs/out/stage1.obj")
print(zb_audit.verdict(zb_audit.audit(obj["path"]), "sculpt"))
zl.call("zb_ops", "save_ztl", "/abs/out/head.ztl")            # head_v001.ztl
zl.stop()
```

## 7. Top 2026 traps

- `set()` on a missing path does nothing and raises nothing. `Transform:Frame` and `Brush:Dam_Standard` do not exist; use `Transform:Fit` and `zb_ops.select_brush("Dam_Standard")`. PolyFrame is `Transform:Pf` (commands.xml id `Transform: Pf`) and perspective is `Draw:Perspective`; `Transform:PolyF` and `Transform:Persp` are not ids.
- `query_mesh3d()` returns lists: `int(zbc.query_mesh3d(1)[0])`.
- A ZScript that pressed Decimation Master or a UV plugin never got control back (ZBrushCentral 2013 and 2014, cgside 2022). Test each plugin press once, with a short timeout and a ping after.
- DynaMesh on a SubTool with levels is expected to raise a modal note [verify]; the wrappers refuse instead. Never Divide a DynaMesh to detail; ZRemesher it first (Pablo, Logic Part 7).
- The ZRemesher target is in thousands and approximate: read the face count back.
- ZHomePage covers the canvas after launch. Cmd+W quits ZBrush on macOS: never send it.
- Item paths ignore case and spaces (SDK docs). The Activity log (Asset Directory `Logs/Activity`) records the canonical path of each press and set, which makes it a free path oracle (strokes are not logged).
