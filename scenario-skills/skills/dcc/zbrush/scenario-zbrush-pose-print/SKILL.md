# ZBrush posing and 3D print

Expert level means a pose that stands and reads, transferred onto every SubTool without losing a level, and print parts whose size, walls, fits and cavities were measured in millimeters on the exported files. The stance: turn every decision into a number the agent can check (scale, point order, joint angles, walls, gaps), keep the pose reversible, use strokes only for cleanup. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-zbrush-expert (bridge, stroke engine, review loop, 2026 traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Gaboury: scale is the first decision.** SubTool number one is a box at the client's size; nothing may clip out of it, and the whole tool resizes in one step because sizes change late (6 in with 15 points of articulation became 4 in with 8). Agent form: `brief_box`, `zb_print.envelope`, `set_export_scale(target_mm)`.
- **Munoz Gomez: pose at the lowest level, several SubTools through Transpose Master, the pose on a 3D Layer.** Plates and carried props (weapon, shield, staff) stay IN the TPose mesh as rigid pieces (Auto Groups, one group per loose piece, masked whole); Move Topological clears intersections. Plouffe forbids deforming primitives, not moving them rigidly: never pull a carried prop out and re-place it with one rotation.
- **Maxon doc: two things destroy a transfer:** a partially hidden SubTool (Vertex Mismatch) and Gizmo 3D deformers on the TPose mesh (they reorder points; SubTools die on TPose>SubT). Pavlovich: "The order of the vertices is very important." Start from a clean project, save the ZPR while a TPose mesh exists (the Transpose Master data lives there).
- **Plouffe: parts that bend together need the same polygon size at level 1** (mask blur spreads per polygon). Re-place bolts and discs after bending. Spend detail only where the final size and viewing distance show it.
- **Pavlovich: DynaMesh without levels = Proxy Pose plus a ZSphere rig.** Location beats size, helpers hold volume, rotate only.
- **Gaboury: never hollow the 9M sculpt.** Shell a light DynaMesh copy (128 was enough for a 9 in car), keep its inner wall, Polish it, subtract it from the untouched detailed part in Live Boolean. Create Shell Thickness is not millimeters: measure.
- **Bennett (Hasbro): 1 mm minimum wall (0.85 mm was flagged), 0.5 mm edges, 0.12 mm fit offset for Formlabs parts;** thin walls are thickened from the inside so the outside does not change.
- **Gaboury: decimate by eye** (about 1M per mesh is plenty; 10k to 20k triangles can still print); masks on the detail that matters (face, hands) steer Decimation Master; pre-process again after any edit; vent every cup on SLA.

## Posing without a mouse

The artists' default (Ctrl+click a polygroup, drag a Gizmo ring) is a canvas gesture. The SDK cannot read mask data, and `press_key` is documented but marked "Does not work, hidden for now" in the installed 2026 stub (with `canvas_click` it is reported unreliable, Maxon forum). Routes by determinism:

| Route                                                             | When                                           | How                                                                                                                                                                        | Status                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| A. Numeric external rig (Munoz Gomez's Blender route, made exact) | humanoids, extreme or many poses               | TPoseMesh, `export_tpose`, `loose_pieces` weighted rigidly to one bone each, scenario-blender-rigging poses by angle and returns the same order, `import_pose`, TPose>SubT | deterministic; guards tested offline                        |
| B. ZSphere rig by code                                            | in ZBrush, organic, or DynaMesh via Proxy Pose | joints from polygroup borders, `zs_build`, forward kinematics `zs_pose`                                                                                                    | FK tested; bound mesh following API edits [verify live_p02] |

Whole-SubTool rigid moves                                      | a base, a stand, a prop added after posing     | `rotate_subtool_matrix` (X, Y, Z) plus `translate_subtool`, the carrier's whole transform, corrected from exports                                                          | math tested; signs [verify live_p03, p08]                   |
| D. Mask plus Gizmo or action line                                 | cleanup by a computer-use agent or a human     | Ctrl+click group, Alt pivot, drag                                                                                                                                          | weak for this agent                                         |

Weak without a human: gesture design, Plouffe's hand-painted gradient masks, large fold redesign. Seam smoothing and Move Topological have agent forms in `procedures.md` P6, still [verify].

## Workflow

`zb_pose.call("name", ...)` runs inside ZBrush; `zb_print` runs on exported OBJs; full code in [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md).

0. **Intake.** Versioned ZTL, `inventory()`, target and envelope in mm. GATE: every SubTool named, unique, with points and levels.
1. **Scale.** `set_export_scale`, `export_parts`, `check_scale`, then `brief_box` (hidden while exporting). GATE: height within 0.5 % [added], one export scale on every part (a part appended from another ZTool arrives at another scale), `envelope` ok, named dimensions checked with `caliper`.
2. **Pose prep.** `clean_project` (ZTL saved, default project, Load Tool); polygroup every segment, plates and props left as loose pieces; `preflight_tpose`. GATE: preflight ok, density spread under 2x [added]. No levels: scenario-zbrush-retopology-export or Proxy Pose.
3. **Pose.** `tpose_mesh(layer=True, groups=True)` with props and plates visible, `export_tpose` (the order reference), `save_project`; route A or B, center first, parents before children, rotations only; no Gizmo deformers. GATE: `rigid_pieces` ok, `follows` puts each carried prop where its carrier took it (0.5 mm [added]), `piece_interference` empty or listed for P6, `tpose_to_subtools(expected, rest_obj)` passes its order guard and point counts, `rigid_delta` within 2 degrees of the plan [added], `balance` stands or a base is planned; review sheet: silhouette and weight read (Plouffe: an unstable pose "destroys the entire work").
4. **Fix deformation.** New layer at the top level. Seam first while the rest is protected (Munoz Gomez smooths and moves before clearing the mask); then volumes and folds re-sculpted for the new pose (tension from the stretched joint, compression on the inner bend [added]); re-place primitives; Move Topological on pieces; pose-specific detail on a pose-only layer, because layers blend linearly. GATE: `stretch_report` near the rest pose, `piece_interference` ok, Polyframe tiles.
5. **Breakdown.** Parts at natural breaks; merge what prints as one (Live Boolean union or DynaMesh on light copies: Hasbro engineers on decimated meshes). Molded: loops, parting line, draft. GATE: each part closed, fits the build volume.
6. **Hollow when asked.** `hollow_copy` (insert inside, DynaMesh about 128, Create Shell), `keep_inner_shell`, Live Boolean: detailed part start, inner shell, drain and vents subtract; thin ends stay solid. Too thin: move the cutter inward, never the outside. GATE: `thickness` p01 at the wall target, no sealed cavity for resin, `outer_drift` ok, vents at cups.
7. **Cut and key.** Cutter QCube in Live Boolean or a polygroup split then Close Holes [added]; `plan_keys`; socket = peg grown by 2 x clearance. GATE: `clearance` median at target, no interference; one key pair test-printed before the kit (Gaboury).
8. **Decimate.** Unique names; per-SubTool budgets, masks before Pre-process (`mask="cavity"` [added]), pre-process after any edit. GATE: faces within budget, `deviation` p99 under the printer's XY resolution [added], close-ups before and after.
9. **Deliver.** STL and 3MF per part in mm, `print_report(..., envelope_mm=...)`, a review tile at real size (detail under the process floor is backfilled, fused or left to paint: Hasbro). GATE: `print_report["ok"]`, every "to look at" item looked at, unit stated.

| Decimation           | about 1M per mesh; 2.7M to 545k at 20 % unchanged; 8k faceted  | Gaboury                         |
| Decimation quality   | 40 to 100 % near identical, 2 to 40 % visible                  | Maxon doc                       |
| Scale with shrink    | height / 12 + 4 % for a 6 in PVC figure                        | Hasbro                          |
| Proxy Pose skin      | Adaptive Skin Density 1, DynaMesh Resolution 0                 | Pavlovich                       |

## Quality gates

- **Measured** (`zb_print` on OBJs in mm): watertight, volume, thin-wall share (0.2 % of samples [added]), sealed cavities, floating shells, height, envelope, one export scale, build volume, clearance, balance, faces, outer drift. Pose: point order, `rigid_pieces`, `follows`, `piece_interference`, `rigid_delta`, `stretch_report`.
- **Visual** (scenario-zbrush-expert `zb_review.review`, MatCap Gray, five views): gesture and balance; joints with Polyframe; primitives round; the grip closed around the handle; the brief box shown once; From Thickness on a copy; every listed spot; decimated close-ups. Judge with [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md).

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from scenario-zbrush-sculpting, scenario-zbrush-character-creature, scenario-zbrush-stylized or scenario-zbrush-hard-surface: a versioned ZTL with named SubTools, levels (or a DynaMesh for Proxy Pose), polygroups per part, the last review sheet; from scenario-zbrush-retopology-export, a projected stack when a sculpt had no levels.
- **Sends** to scenario-blender-rigging or scenario-maya-expert: the TPose OBJ and a plan (joints, angles, rigid pieces per bone), expecting the same vertex order back.
- **Delivers** posed sculpts (layers, ZTL, ZPR, sheets) to scenario-zbrush-paint-render; print packages (STL and 3MF in mm, report, sheets, part and key list) to the user or the printer.

## ZBrush 2026 notes

- Proxy Pose (2023.1) is in Tool > Geometry. Transpose Master still ships ("inactive after a file save" fixed in 2025.2); its data lives in the ZPR. The doc's clean project, DefaultCube.ZPR, is not in the 2026.2.1 install: `Lightbox/Projects/DefaultProject.ZPR` is used [verify].
- 3D Print Hub has Export to 3MF (errors fixed in 2026.2.1). Update Size Ratios and Scale Master Set Scene Scale open dialogs: use the export scale route.
- From Thickness (2026.2.1 labels Min Thickness, Max Thickness, Ball or Ray) asks "Too many polygons... proceed?" above Max Thickness Polygons; that note stalls the bridge, so `from_thickness` refuses first.
- Live Boolean drops UVs, creases, 3D layers and masks on the result: boolean the print copy. Decimation Master and Transpose Master are ZScript plugins: check that control returns (live_p01, p07). Cmd+W quits ZBrush on macOS.
