# Sources of scenario-zbrush-stylized

Each entry: source, who, credential, where, what it is best for, best timestamps. Notes live in the project's `notes/` folder; digests are `_digest_*.md`.

## Revisions

- 2026-09-24 v1: first build (kept in `skills/_versions/zbrush-stylized v1 2026-09-24/`).
- 2026-09-24 v2, round 1 refactor from the blind grade Z1 (missing from both, errors): stylized plane breaks kept through subdivision (DynaMesh merge, ZRemesher, `crease_planes` with Groups By Normals, Crease PG and CreaseLvl, then Divide; Guillaume [00:46:42]-[00:47:50]); head sides clipped to taper and kept an arc, measured by `head_taper` on a top view (Shane [02:00:26], [02:11:58]); eyes as spheres wrapped by lids, turned outward, judged on a perspective look render (pointer to scenario-zbrush-sculpting P17 and `persp_snapshot_code`); scarf drape by Dynamics cloth as an option; polypaint at the top level judged on SkinShade4 (Pablo VRisbJQAaZw [00:23:40], [00:24:54]); perspective path fixed to `Draw:Perspective` and installed command ids tried first in `PATHS`; examples generalized beyond the adventurer bust. Tests: 43 offline (was 40), live_04 added (not yet run in ZBrush).
