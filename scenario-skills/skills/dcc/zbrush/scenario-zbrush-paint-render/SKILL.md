# ZBrush paint and render (texture and presentation artist)

Expert paint in ZBrush is observation made systematic: color zones placed by what lies under the skin, pushed enough to survive the shader, judged on neutral and flat views, and baked at a resolution the mesh can hold. For an agent without a tablet most of it is buttons: fills at a chosen intensity through generated masks, zone images projected onto the mesh, and renders that are both measured and looked at. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-zbrush-expert (bridge, stroke engine, review loop, 2026 traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Paint last, at the top level.** Polypaint is one color per vertex: a lower level paints blurry, adding levels afterwards breaks it, and the map follows the point count (about 4M points per 2K map; 4K is wasted there) (FlippedNormals).
- **Judge on neutral and flat.** SkinShade4 or MatCap White01, plus Flat Color. A tinted MatCap makes you overcompensate and the export looks wrong elsewhere (FlippedNormals, Pablo).
- **Structure before beauty.** Start with a pure yellow, red and blue zone map placed by anatomy: bone and fat yellow, thin tissue red, hollows blue, more blue low on a man. Then cover it with skin color at low opacity so the zones shimmer through (Pablo). For an agent this is also the route that can be checked in numbers.
- **Masks are "the real trick" (Pablo):** generator, Mask Adjust, Inverse, color through the mask. The agent's big soft brush is FillObject at low RGB Intensity through the inverted mask: it scales with RGB Intensity (FlippedNormals), Pavlovich fills through an inverted AO mask, and the tooltip reads "Fill 3D Object Masked".
- **Saturation is the stylization dial (Pablo); paint to be diluted (FlippedNormals).** Shaders wash polypaint out. Pick the final renderer before deciding how far to push, and keep realistic skin under the middle of the picker.
- **Contrast directs the eye.** The strongest value or saturation contrast goes to the eyes, and the eyes and mouth get the most time (FlippedNormals).
- **Small and fast, then big and slow (Pavlovich).** Test small at a high Error Threshold, compare renders side by side, and rebuild the beauty from passes instead of re-rendering.
- **Visibility traps (Maxon docs).** A displayed texture hides polypaint. In Redshift only Polypaint materials show paint (Use Material Color 0, white Base), SSS Weight 1 hides it, and MatCaps show no texture.

## Workflow

Toolkit: [`scripts/zb_paint.py`](scripts/zb_paint.py), ZBrush-side functions through `zp.remote("name", ...)`; full code in [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md). Save a versioned ZTL after every stage: there is no undo control.

1. **Preflight.** `paint_state()` (level, points, UVs, texture display), `recommend_map_size(points)`, `texture_off()`, save a ZTL. GATE: top level, `map_budget(points, side)` passes, v001 on disk. Divide now if needed, never after painting.
2. **Setup and base.** `set_paint_mode("rgb")` (Zadd and Zsub off), `fill(colour, 100)`: a dull skin base (FlippedNormals, doc) or pure yellow for the zone route (Pablo). GATE: the Flat front shows the fill color; Colorize reads on.
3. **Zone map.** Parts (eyes, scarf, teeth, clothes): `fill_subtools`. Polygroups: review with `polypaint_from_polygroups()`, fill exactly with `zone_fill_by_split()` (Duplicate, Groups Split, fill each piece, Project All back with Colorize on). Anatomy on one mesh: `skin_zone_plan` → `zone_image` → `polypaint_from_image` (planar UVs, before real UVs); synthesized Color Spray strokes as the fallback. GATE: `skin_zone_checks(stage="zones")`: forehead yellower than midface, midface redder, a man's lower third bluer, each by at least one JND (2.3 Lab); visually a clown on purpose (Pablo), every zone on its anatomy.
4. **Cover and breakup.** Skin color at 20 to 40 percent over the zones (doc RGB about 30; Pablo's low-opacity cover); breakup from zone-image noise or Color Spray strokes. GATE: `stage="covered"`: no clown (at most 5 percent of skin pixels above saturation 0.75 [added]), speckle present.
5. **Mask passes** with `mask_pass`: cavity darker and redder at 20 to 40 percent; PeaksAndValleys (PVRange 14) or Smoothness with a pale warm fill; `ao_plugin` mask with a purple-red undertone (ping after). Pablo's Adjust Colors is a dialog [verify live_p06]; a low fill through the same mask replaces it. Mask data cannot be read: prove a mask with `mask_coverage(masked, cleared)`. GATE: each pass shifts the region statistics a little, together they read as skin, back of the head included.
6. **Focus and finish.** Eyes: an iris image (dark ring, lighter bottom, darker top, lighter toward the pupil) projected onto the eye SubTool, then slight divergence; lips; selective darkening only where light never reaches unless the renderer adds no AO; a 5 to 10 percent wash for realism. GATE: final `skin_zone_checks` with eye contrast, then the Flat, SkinShade4 and MatCap White01 sheets (`paint_review`) judged with [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md).
7. **Deliver the color.** `texture_from_polypaint(path, side, flip_v=True)` needs UVs (UV Master on a clone, Paste UVs keeps polypaint); or OBJ vertex color; or Substance Bridge Send PolyPaint. GATE: map budget passes, an asymmetric mark lands where expected, file on disk.
8. **Render.** Save, `set_document_size` (small for tests; Resize clears the canvas, the function redraws), `render_setup` (perspective, shadows, AO), `bpr_render` or `paint_views(..., "bpr")` for matched views. GATE: `render_checks` pass and the renders were looked at at 100 percent.
9. **Passes and turntable.** `export_bpr_pass` (may open a dialog); clown pass by `subtool_solo_views` plus `id_pass` (paint and polygroups untouched); `composite` (shadow and AO Multiply through the mask); `turntable_frames` in short chunks, `assemble_turntable`. GATE: every frame upright with constant framing; the composite beats the beauty toggled against it.
10. **Portfolio and report.** Gray form views (`colorize_all(False)`, `zb_review.review`, restore), albedo and beauty views, ID pass, turntable, one sheet. Report what was measured, what was only looked at, what did not run.

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** `paint_state` (top level, Rgb on, Zadd off, texture off); `map_budget`; `mask_coverage` above 0 before a masked fill; `skin_zone_checks` on a front Flat render with `head_regions_front()` or regions projected from landmarks; `render_checks` (framing, value span, clipping, noise); `upright_score` on turntable frames with a top marker; files on disk with sizes.
- **Visual:** Flat, SkinShade4 and MatCap White01 sheets in five views for color, and the BPR or Redshift beauty for the final read. Check each at 100 percent for breakup and edges, and as a thumbnail for zones and values. Look for beige or clown, lips, eye focus, the back of the head, bruises, cut shadows and grain. The rubric is `references/critique.md`.

## Handoffs

- **Receives:** from scenario-zbrush-sculpting, scenario-zbrush-character-creature or scenario-zbrush-stylized, a final versioned ZTL at its top level with `stats()` and its last review sheet, plus eyes and parts as named SubTools. From scenario-zbrush-hard-surface, parts as SubTools with creases. From scenario-zbrush-pose-print, a posed ZTL (paint with symmetry before posing when possible [added]).
- **Delivers to scenario-zbrush-retopology-export:** the painted ZTL, the map side from `recommend_map_size`, and either the exported color map (`texture_from_polypaint`) or a request for UVs on a clone before the bake. Multi Map Exporter's Texture from Polypaint runs in that skill's map batch.
- **Delivers to the user:** the beauty renders, gray and albedo sheets, passes and composite, the turntable MP4 or GIF, the portfolio sheet and the ZTL path, with what was verified.
- **Sister teams:** scenario-blender-texturing-shading and scenario-maya-expert for lookdev with vertex color or maps; scenario-zbrush-automation for batch renders.

## ZBrush 2026 notes

- Redshift needs its separate application; AOVs with OIDN since 2025.1, Cinema 4D-matched materials since 2025.2. BPR is unchanged.
- Substance Bridge (2026.2) sends polypaint to Painter as a fill layer; its Force UV Auto-Unwrap strips every SubTool's UVs.
- Movies: MP4 (MOV on macOS), resized above 4095 px. Mask by Smoothness fixed in 2024; ZRemesher Keep Polypaint since 2023; Ambient Occlusion plugin since 2021.6.
- `zb_paint.PATHS` tags each path; many are [strings] (label exists in this build) or [verify]. Run `live_p01_paint_paths.py` first: `set()` on a missing path is silent.
- Nothing in `zb_paint` has run in ZBrush yet; 36 offline tests pass; live tests `tests/code/zbrush-paint-render/live_p01` to `p06`.
