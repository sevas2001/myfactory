# Expert notes: polypaint, rendering, presentation

The depth behind SKILL.md, by expert, with source and timestamp. Video ids resolve to URLs in `sources.md`. `[added]` marks this skill's own reasoning or thresholds; `[strings]` marks labels read from this build's UI string table (`ZData/ZLang/english/UInterface.zsc`, 2026-09-24), which prove a label exists, not its palette position.

## 1. FlippedNormals: Henning Sanden and Morten Jaeger (8iAbH3zSQak, 2018)

Former senior film character artists (MPC, Cinesite). ZBrush 2018 on screen, tools unchanged in 2026.

Principles

- The common failure is uniform beige "skin color". Real skin gets its hues from veins, fat and bone underneath [00:00:56 to 00:02:03].
- Color zones in thirds, from James Gurney's "Color Zones of the Face": golden or yellow forehead; red middle third (cheeks, nose, ears); blue, green or gray lower third in men (beard shadow). "Not a hard rule, just a tool" [00:00:31 to 00:01:29].
- Depth decides the hue. Where bone is near the surface the color is lighter and less saturated, "like red latex stretched over a fist" [00:20:50]. Thin skin shows blood; fat hides it [00:01:29].
- Paint broad first, like an underpainting or an airbrusher. The start looks bad on purpose [00:04:01 to 00:05:40].
- Organic speckle beats smooth gradients: Stroke Color Spray with Alpha 07 or 08 gives it "for free" [00:04:35 to 00:05:40]. Blend by sampling a neighbor color (C) and painting across, never by blurring [00:06:01].
- Polypaint is per vertex ("every vertex a color, not every polygon"). A lower level paints blurry. Paint only when the sculpt is done, and never add levels afterwards [00:08:17 to 00:08:50].
- Judge color on a neutral material: SkinShade4 (neutral but bright) or MatCap White01 (no crazy specular), plus a Flat Color view. A red or skin-tinted MatCap makes you overcompensate [00:10:51 to 00:12:29].
- Value: darken selectively where light never reaches (inside the nostrils, deep creases). Avoid painting shadows in general [00:14:16 to 00:15:57].
- Contrast directs the eye. Put the strongest value or saturation contrast at the eyes, and spend most time on eyes and mouth, where digital doubles usually fail [00:18:44 to 00:20:22].
- Paint to be diluted. Matcaps flatter depth, and much of the variation "disappears the moment you put it into a shader", so exaggerate [00:25:26 to 00:26:13].
- Texture size follows vertex count. About 4M polygons needs about a 2K map (2048 x 2048 is about 4M pixels). A 4K map (16M pixels) is wasted on a 4M mesh, and soft paint would even survive at 1K [00:30:32 to 00:31:22].
- Hand paint the broad pass in ZBrush; pore-level color comes from polarized photos or projected scan maps in Mari [00:21:56 to 00:24:21].

Numbers

- FillObject applies at the current RGB Intensity: 10 percent fills at 10 percent [00:02:16 to 00:02:51].
- Paint mode: Rgb on, Zadd and Zsub off, else you sculpt while painting [00:03:09].
- Rgb Intensity 100 at first, around 41 later; Z Intensity 25; Draw Size about 6 to 16 (frame readouts) [00:03:08 to 00:22:38].
- Alpha 22 at full intensity gives veins [00:21:23].
- Multi Map Exporter, Texture From Polypaint: Map Size by vertex count, Map Border high (frames show 4 and 16), FlipV on, Create All Maps; UVs required [00:29:59 to 00:31:54].

Mistakes: painting on a lower level; adding levels after painting; a tinted matcap; shadows painted everywhere; smeared lips on a character that needs tight lips [00:13:51]; a map too big for the mesh; forgetting FlipV [00:31:54].

## 2. Pablo Munoz Gomez (d03QU-eUaPo, livestream 2025-10-01)

Concept and character artist, ZBrushLIVE presenter, Pablander Academy founder. The most agent-friendly recipe in the sources: after a short zone map, almost every refinement is a mask plus a color operation.

Order of work

1. Material: SkinShade4, or his free "Albedo Polypaint" matcap (no reflection, a little shading). A colored matcap contaminates the color and the export looks awful elsewhere [00:44:58 to 00:46:36].
2. Zone map in pure hues. Fill pure yellow (Color > FillObject), then paint yellow at the top, red in the middle, blue (more cyan) at the bottom with symmetry on [00:46:36 to 00:48:11]. The choices "are not arbitrary" [00:55:26]:
   - Yellow where fat or bone blocks light: cranium, glabella, nose bridge, fat around the eyes, prominent cheekbones [00:49:16 to 00:49:49, 00:55:26].
   - Red where tissue is thin or SSS is strong: eyelids, ear cartilage, nostrils, mouth [00:50:21 to 00:50:56].
   - Blue in hollows and in areas that receive less light: cheeks over the teeth, orbits, above the clavicle, parietal and occipital regions [00:50:56 to 00:52:37, 00:54:51].
   - Male: more blue low (stubble) [00:48:11]. Fat character: more yellow [00:48:42]. Female: less blue at the bottom, more red [00:54:18].
   - Duplicate the SubTool at each stage as a comparison frame [00:55:58].
3. Blend with texture: Color Spray with Alpha 08 in between colors, noisy breakup, checked in Render > Flat against Preview [01:02:03 to 01:03:46]. "Still looks like a clown" is the expected state here [01:05:27].
4. Cover with skin: a fleshy neutral color over the whole face at low opacity, so the zones shine through; then a lighter yellowish color; then saturated orange-red accents on membranes with a higher RGB Intensity and a smaller brush [01:06:35 to 01:12:08]. Darker skin: purple instead of blue, orange instead of red, same zones [01:06:35]. Experienced painters can skip the pure-hue stage [01:08:14].
5. Integrate: Solo so the eyes stop recoloring with the active SubTool; bluish desaturated tones, pink cheeks, a darker tone toward the center of the face, a dark mouth interior [01:12:40 to 01:14:54].
6. Cavity pass at the highest level: Mask By Cavity; the raw mask is harsh, so shape it in Mask Adjust and Apply; invert; hide the mask display; paint a darker, redder color with a large brush; clear [01:16:40 to 01:20:29].
7. Smoothness pass: PeaksAndValleys tried with PVRange 14 and less coverage, then Mask By Smoothness with a larger Range; Mask Adjust; invert; Tool > Polypaint > Adjust Colors with the mask hidden: saturation down, hue toward yellow, intensity up, RGB contrast on blue; clear [01:26:05 to 01:29:59].
8. Peaks and valleys pass on a region, a little more saturated and darker [01:29:59].
9. Wash: a very light color at large size and low intensity desaturates for realism [01:31:16]. He keeps the unwashed version because he likes saturation.
10. Creature tint on the whole mesh: Adjust Colors, Tint 1 to preview a pinkish red, then reduce; Hue, Saturation, Intensity; RGB Intensity per channel; RGB Contrast [01:31:53 to 01:33:29].
11. Color variance on the brush (Stroke > Modifiers, about 0.5) [01:34:01, uncertain caption]. Paint very saturated red where a later wash will pull it back [01:35:39].
12. Ambient Occlusion plugin: Zplugin > Ambient Occlusion > Compute makes a ray-traced AO mask with contact shadows, far more accurate and faster than Mask By AO on millions of polygons; invert; tint (test with green first), then a purple-red undertone [01:37:25 to 01:39:04].
13. Finish the back of the head to the level of the face [01:39:49].
14. Eyes: a dark iris over most of the visible eye; lighter at the bottom and darker at the top to fake the cornea lens; lighter toward the pupil; then rotate the eyes slightly apart, because straight eyes look dead [01:41:30 to 01:47:03].
15. Export: polypaint is vertex color. OBJ with polypaint into Marmoset or Blender, or Substance Painter as an albedo base [01:49:50 to 01:52:39].

Principles

- Saturation is the stylization dial. Realistic skin stays in the lower-left, desaturated half of the picker; crossing the middle takes it into stylized territory [01:10:30 to 01:11:35].
- Highlights desaturate toward the light color and shadows look more saturated. Pushing saturation past the natural norm reads as stylized, even under realistic light [01:22:45 to 01:25:00].
- Photo references are usually color-boosted: do not copy their saturation [01:35:06].
- Mask Adjust is the control point of every generated mask [01:17:45].
- Polypaint during sculpting is a "working polypaint" that holds the palette, not a texture [01:01:32].

## 3. Maxon documentation: polypaint, color, masking, Spotlight, texture maps

`sources/docs/paint-pose-render-print__polypaint-spotlight.md` (12 pages, 2026 help site).

- Polypaint needs no UVs and no fixed map size; resolution lives in the mesh ("Make sure there are sufficient polygons"). Spotlight is polypaint too (Polypaint; Spotlight basics).
- A displayed texture map hides polypaint: Texture Off before painting or projecting (Spotlight basics; Painting a Head).
- FillObject obeys the draw mode: Mrgb assigns color and material, Rgb color only, M material only (Color palette). The shipped CreateEyeballs macro stores Draw:Mrgb, Rgb, M and Color:R, G, B, sets Mrgb 1, fills, then restores all of them (macros doc).
- Colorize on an unpainted SubTool fills it white; afterwards it toggles the display (Polypaint reference).
- Polypaint From Polygroups turns group colors into paint; the reverse trip through a texture is "unlikely to be precise" (Polypaint reference).
- Painting a Head values: cover with a dull tone (Colorized Spray, Draw Size 150); zones with Draw Size 100 or less at RGB Intensity about 30; Alpha 25 for spatter; unify with a light near-white color at RGB Intensity about 10 "as a wash", never opaque in one spot. "The forehead is usually yellowish, the muzzle of the mouth is reddish and the ears have a slightly purplish tint. Think in terms of warm and cool color combinations."
- Mask By Cavity: Blur 100 softens, Intensity sharpens (negative inverts), a Cavity Profile curve maps depth to mask. View it with Preferences > Edit > Masked Object Dimming at 5 and the Flat Color material.
- Mask Ambient Occlusion: Occlusion Intensity enlarges the dark area, AO ScanDist the reach, AO Aperture the spread; view with Flat Color. Mask By Smoothness: set Range and Falloff before pressing. PeaksAndValleys: PVRange (falloff distance), PVCoverage (amount). Mask By Color (Intensity, Hue, Saturation) reads the texture or, without one, the polypaint.
- Mask Adjust Apply is "absolute rather than accumulative": repeated presses change nothing unless Blur changes.
- Mask by PolyPaint: eight color channels with tolerance, Blur up to 25; grayed out without visible polypaint.
- Flip and Mirror by Posable Symmetry: store an undo marker, Mask Changed Points, Flip mask by posable symmetry, Inverse, Mirror By Posable Symmetry. Without a mask, Mirror averages both sides (faded).
- Spotlight: import to the Texture palette, Add To Spotlight; Shift+Z toggles, Z paints; Radius 0 disables painting; Opacity does not change the amount painted (RGB and Z Intensity do); pure black is transparent; Pin Spotlight repeats one spot; Nudge distorts to fit a sculpt.
- Convert a texture to polypaint: divide until the polycount is near the texture's pixel count ("a 2k texture map has 4 million pixels in it. Your UVs only use 70% or less of that space so the pixel count is close to 3 million"), then Polypaint From Texture.
- Bake polypaint to a map: UVs at SDiv 1 (PUV, UV Master or outside, Store MT trick), UV Map Size 2048, SDiv highest, Texture Map > New From Polypaint. Fix Seam repairs background color at seams; New From UV Check shows overlaps in red.

## 4. Michael Pavlovich: Redshift in depth (040hAJ3-cTw, 2025)

Director of Character, Weapon and Vehicle Art at Certain Affinity, ZBrushLIVE streamer. ZBrush 2025 on Windows.

- Turn Render > Redshift Renderer > Redshift on once; BPR or Shift+R then renders with Redshift; every render stays in the BPR and AOV slots [00:02:25 to 00:02:56].
- Perspective on (P) before rendering, or the render is orthographic [00:02:56].
- Floor: Shift+P; Elevation -1 snaps to the lowest SubTool; raise Grid Size so shadows are not cut [00:03:51 to 00:04:58, 00:37:50]. Store Cam for repeatable views; focal length 50 [00:05:16 to 00:05:48].
- Color and material per SubTool: standard brush, ZAdd off, M or MRGB, RGB Intensity 100, Color > Fill Object. Filling turns Colorize on. Shift-click the Colorize icon toggles it for all SubTools [00:09:02 to 00:12:54].
- Ctrl+R renders a region; Escape pauses; Escape during a bucket render stops it and still denoises [00:13:25, 00:45:09].
- Smooth Surface is on for every SubTool by default and averages normals: "bruises" on low-poly meshes. Turn it off and use control loops or creases with Dynamic Subdivision. Crease Level one below SmoothSubdiv (3 with 4) gives a soft edge highlight; equal gives razor CG edges [00:14:01 to 00:21:26].
- Keep the ZBrush main light on at 0.1 intensity: off makes material previews vanish [00:23:12]. The background slot lights the scene even with Use Default Panorama off [00:33:32]. EXR gamma 2.2; a JPEG loads at 1 and sticks [00:34:06 to 00:35:11].
- Shadow catcher: floor material Shadow Catcher, or any material with Is Shadow Catcher 1; floor reflections with Metalness 1 and low roughness [00:37:19 to 00:40:16].
- Render Recall keeps the last 100 renders with material, light, color and filter settings; compare side by side, re-render from a recalled state; depth of field is not stored [00:41:10 to 00:42:17, 00:51:34].
- Speed ladder: a smaller document first, then Error Threshold (0.01 default; 1 took 4 s instead of 9 s), then iterations; Progressive 64 default, 25 with denoise for checks, 1 is useless [00:28:52, 00:43:00 to 00:47:55].
- Image size: Document Width 1920, Pro off, Height 1080, Resize, clear, redraw, Edit; tests at 720 x 405 or 1280 x 720 [00:27:45 to 00:30:33].
- Use Material Color 0: polypaint drives color; keep the Base swatch white [00:52:05 to 00:53:52]. Glass IOR 1.5, water 1.333, iron 2.95 [00:57:47]. SSS scale depends on units (C4D cm, ZBrush mm), mode 2 Random Walk most accurate [00:59:07]. Emission Weight 100 overrides polypaint and adds noise [01:00:34].
- Camera movie: keyframe camera positions on the Timeline, one Redshift render first, then Ctrl+Shift click the slider to render every frame; Export with H [01:02:00 to 01:04:42]. Save a render preset (Render:Save) and a ZPR for materials and lights [01:05:28].

## 5. Michael Pavlovich: Redshift quickstart and turntable (FvpG2tCP8Lw, 2025)

- ZPlugin > SubTool Master > Fill "color and material" fills every SubTool at once [00:06:50].
- Drag-and-drop of Redshift materials crashed his 2025 build: select the material, M, Fill Object [00:04:25].
- Use Material Color 1 overrides polypaint; setting it back to 0 still tints with the swatch, so set the swatch white [00:05:13 to 00:06:16].
- Loading the default EXR looks dark: raise Redshift Exposure from 0.35 to 1 [00:10:02].
- Turntable: Movie palette, Document, Large, overlay and background image opacity 0, frames (180 default; he meant 30), then a Redshift render first; Movie > Turntable renders every frame with Redshift. Without the prior Redshift render it records viewport quality, a quick preview [00:19:24 to 00:20:28]. Escape did not stop it [00:21:00]. Check the frame count before launching.

## 6. Michael Pavlovich: Redshift and BPR passes for compositing (lEP73nEu3Tc, 2025)

- Rebuild the beauty from passes so each component gets its own levels, hue and opacity; tuning beats re-rendering [00:04:34, 00:11:41].
- Document at print size: 3200 x 2133 px (4 x 6 postcard proportion) [00:01:13].
- Redshift AOVs: All, Denoise All; save Beauty, Diffuse, Reflection, Shadow, AO, GI, Depth, World Position, Bump Normal; skip unused ones. Add BPR Depth and Mask [00:02:18 to 00:02:38].
- Utility passes hide masks in single channels: check R, G, B of normals and world position [00:03:30].
- Blend modes: Diffuse base; Reflection Screen (or Soft Light for BPR reflections) with clipped Levels and Hue/Sat; Shadow and AO Multiply, tinted cool; GI Lighten; rim and fill Screen; bloom Screen [00:05:46 to 00:26:32].
- Keep a stored camera so every pass lines up [00:12:21]. Turn Redshift off before BPR passes [00:12:53].
- BPR AO: blur 1, resolution up, rays up a little; his Redshift AO looked better [00:12:55, 00:20:25].
- Cheap BPR light passes: Standard Basic material (not Redshift), color black so only light shows, Specular 84 with a tighter curve, one light sent behind and left for "light rim", the other side broader and weaker for "light fill" [00:14:55 to 00:16:27]. Generic reflection: Colorize off for all, white, a shiny MatCap [00:13:49].
- Clown pass: Polyframe lines off, Flat Color, one polygroup per SubTool, white [00:16:50]. Selections by part in the composite [00:19:20].
- Finishing: lens blur from depth, dodge, burn, fake SSS on midtones, bloom, background gradient [00:23:20 to 00:27:25].

## 7. Michael Pavlovich: Redshift Baker 360 (mW4P0T6tR7k, 2025)

- Any material can be baked: set up lights and materials as for a render, then Redshift Baker 360 projects the look into polypaint from many angles [00:01:22 to 00:03:11]. Total steps = Longitude x Latitude (doc).
- Judge the bake with Flat Color in a neutral scene; if moving the light changes nothing, the bake worked [00:05:47]. MicroPoly in Dynamic Subdivision makes the preview look wrong [00:04:15].
- Polish: Adjust Colors; ZPlugin Ambient Occlusion mask with Occlusion Volume for all SubTools, inverted, a navy color, Color > Fill Object adds baked AO [00:06:18 to 00:07:06]. This is the expert evidence that FillObject paints through a mask.
- Texture: New From Polypaint, Clone Texture, Texture > Export as JPEG [00:07:49 to 00:08:36]. "An easy way to bake in some ambient occlusion, some lighting, and material properties to get a reliable color map" [00:08:05].

## 8. Maxon documentation: rendering (Redshift, BPR, LightCap, KeyShot, movies)

`sources/docs/paint-pose-render-print__rendering-redshift-bpr-keyshot.md`.

- Redshift is a separate application that must be installed; GPU if supported, else CPU. On this Mac `mx1 product list` shows Redshift "uninstalled, unlicensed" (2026-09-24): BPR is the renderer until Emmanuel installs it.
- BPR renders 3D models anti-aliased at full document size with all SubTools; Best is for 2D work.
- Smooth Surface: "designed for making low resolution and faceted meshes look good, so don't use it with high resolution meshes!"
- Redshift Polypaint Materials have Use Material Color off, so polypaint drives color; Preset Color Materials override it. Textures need a Redshift material (MatCaps will not show them); higher SSS Weight shows less polypaint (1 shows none); LightCaps are not supported by Redshift; Redshift materials hide polyframes.
- PBR: Metalness 0 to 1, keep Reflection Weight 1, dielectric IOR 1.4 to 1.6, SSS Mode 2 random walk for thin detailed geometry, Coat IOR 1 disables coat. Transmission needs Double on.
- Gamma Correction 2.2 on Windows, 1.8 on macOS.
- Tests: Disable DynamicSubdiv, ArrayMesh, NanoMesh. Render Recall does not reload the model. Region render Ctrl+R.
- AOVs: Beauty, Shadow (cast shadows as white), SSS, GI (multiplied by diffuse), Background, Diffuse, Reflection (no light speculars), Refraction; possibly AO, World Position, Bump Normal, Depth (flagged "may not make it into the release"). The 2026.2.1 string table lists Beauty, Shadow, AO, SSS, GI, Depth, Background, Bump Normal, Diffuse, Object ID, World Position, Reflection, Refraction and "Export All to PSD" [strings]. Depth filter Full for anti-aliased, Center Sample for exact depth.
- BPR passes: click a pass icon to save; Shadow and AO need their options on before rendering. The Shaded pass is not anti-aliased at the silhouette on purpose: composite with the Mask pass.
- Print resolution: pixels = inches x ppi (300 ppi for magazine or book); resize the document before starting.
- Redshift and Turntable/TimeLine: "Simply do a Redshift render first then do the Turntable."
- KeyShot bridge: one-way; save KeyShot renders yourself.
- Movies: MP4 on both systems, MOV on macOS since 2025; width or height above 4095 px is resized (version deltas 3.9).

## 9. Related experts outside this skill's folders

- Pavlovich, topology video (n5_cZK-9peg, 2023): for ZRemesher density he isolates a polygroup and uses Color > FillObject at Rgb Intensity 100, starting from a white fill [01:00:48 to 01:02:38]. That is a zone fill by polygroup, done with Ctrl+Shift clicks the SDK cannot send.
- #AskZBrush, Joseph Drust (_ips3GhWI0s, 2016): Project All transfers polypaint only when the target has polypaint enabled; otherwise a popup asks. Project geometry first, color last [00:05:25 to 00:06:29].
- #AskZBrush UV clips (cemmalvugFk): never unwrap the subdivided, painted SubTool in UV Master directly; Work on Clone, Copy UVs, Paste UVs, because control painting erases polypaint [00:04:00 to 00:07:28].
- Character digest: Berger (Lightstorm) keeps color as a separate approval and presents grayscale to discuss anatomy [PcuC8K-bz44 00:06:33, 00:37:47]; Blizzard polypaints the blockout to read the design [FRZtVXpAokc 00:37:33]; Guillaume adds no color until the modeling is tight and checks a grayscale value read with the strongest contrast at the face [UthCuDB1IEQ 00:48:59]. Deciding condition: design exploration uses color, production and anatomy approval stay gray.

## 11. What transfers to an agent without a mouse [added]

- Transfers well (deterministic): FillObject at a chosen RGB Intensity, per SubTool, through a generated mask, through a hidden or split polygroup; every mask generator plus Mask Adjust, Inverse, Clear; AO plugin; Polypaint From Polygroups; Polypaint From Texture from an image the agent generates; New From Polypaint; BPR and Document:Export; scripted turntables; Python composites of passes; numeric color gates on Flat renders.
- Transfers partly: zone layout (a generated zone image through planar UVs, or synthesized Color Spray strokes with the proven stroke engine; placement is good, organic breakup is weaker than a hand); eyes and lips (a generated iris image on a spherical-UV eye; lips by mask or stroke).
- Stays weak: sampling blends with C (pixol_pick plus a low-intensity stroke is a rough stand-in), Spotlight dial work (clicks and drags on a widget: a computer-use path), curve widgets (Mask Adjust and Cavity profiles: keep defaults, vary Blur), the Adjust Colors dialog until live_p06 shows it is scriptable.
