# ZBrush Expert Skills

Agent skills that let Claude (Claude Code) or Codex drive Maxon ZBrush the way the experts in the best tutorials, studio talks and official documentation do. Built on 2026-09-24 with the same method as [Blender Expert Skills](../blender/README.md): transcripts of top-rated videos, cited expert notes, then skills with tools and review rubrics, graded blind against the same model without them. Start with the lead skill, `scenario-zbrush-expert`.

## Status

- 9 skills written from 150 expert videos (61 h) and 54 documentation pages, each with references and a `zb_<domain>.py` module.
- Blind-graded written scenarios (round 1): 43 % without the skills, 91 % with them; all 7 scenarios improved.
- The agent bridge into ZBrush was proven live (scripted strokes that sculpt, dialog-free exports). Full live tests of every skill were blocked by a ZBrush startup stall; see `tests/OPEN_ISSUES.md` in the build project.

## Requirements

ZBrush 2026 (2026.2) with the agent bridge described in the lead skill `scenario-zbrush-expert` (launch, strokes, review renders, dialog-free export).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill scenario-zbrush-expert --skill scenario-zbrush-automation --skill scenario-zbrush-character-creature --skill scenario-zbrush-hard-surface --skill scenario-zbrush-paint-render --skill scenario-zbrush-pose-print --skill scenario-zbrush-retopology-export --skill scenario-zbrush-sculpting --skill scenario-zbrush-stylized
```

The installer puts the skills side by side, which the specialists need: they import the lead skill's `scripts/`. In the installer picker (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills`), the family is the "Expert tools: ZBrush" group. Update with `npx skills update`.

## Provenance

Ported from [edemaistre/zbrush-expert-skills](https://github.com/edemaistre/zbrush-expert-skills/tree/v0.1), built on 2026-09-24, with these changes: the `scenario-` prefix on every skill name, this repository's frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`), no version line in the skill bodies, the sibling-install line in each `SKILL.md`, and paths into the build project made relative.

Paths such as `tests/code/...` or `archive/tests/...` inside the references point to the build project (tests, notes) on the author's machine; they are provenance only.
