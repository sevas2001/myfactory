Each entry: expert, credential, where, what it is best for, best timestamps. Per-source notes live in the project's `notes/anatomy/`, `notes/character/`, `notes/creature/` and `notes/hair-fibers/`. Stylized hair notes in `hair-fibers/` (Dan Eder) belong to scenario-zbrush-stylized and were not used here.

## Sister skills used for shape

- scenario-blender-sculpting (Blender Expert Skills project): the layout of a domain skill with a design table and gated stages.

## Revision log

- 2026-09-24, v1: first build (SKILL.md, five references, `zb_character.py`, 42 offline tests). Snapshot: `skills/_versions/zbrush-character-creature v1 2026-09-24/`.
- 2026-09-24, v2 (refactor after the Z2 blind grade, `tests/grading/Z2_grade.md`): stack route chosen before the first Divide with `stack_check` (SDK only: regular to about 20 to 25M plus a tiled micro map; computer use: 3 to 4 regular plus 3 to 4 HD; never HD over 6 or 7 regular levels); reprojection safety and danger zones (C19, `spike_report`, FlippedNormals Zp07GW3rND0); alpha tests on the model and calibration dots (C8, `dots_check`); big-form asymmetry (C12, `asymmetry_report`); Surface Noise guards (C7); SSS survival and brush order (`detail_survival`, critique); map consistency and UDIM plumbing (C20, `map_request_check`); decimate a copy; wrinkle direction across the compression and staged cracks (C10, C17, `crack_tree`); the 2026 Dam_Standard name (`brush_check`, live_c01); Redshift, Asset Directory (`alpha_library_dir`) and Substance Bridge; aimed, mesh-derived stamp regions instead of canvas fractions (C9, `aim_at`, `region_on_canvas`). Fixed: the Starkie attribution (he gives no numbers; Z 2 to 3 is Costa's) and the HD numbers (HD total = regular top x 4 per HD level; 3 DivideHD over 16M hits the 1 billion ceiling). 54 offline tests pass.
