# GUI paths: the same procedures by hand (for a computer-use agent or a human)

Palette paths, hotkeys, brushes and settings behind procedures C1 to C20. Hotkeys come from the source videos (2018 to 2025 builds); treat any hotkey as [verify] on 2026.2.1. On macOS, ZBrush docs write "Ctrl" for Command in most places, but Control+W assigns a polygroup and **Cmd+W quits ZBrush** since 2023.0.1: never send Cmd+W. Brush files named below exist in `/Applications/Maxon ZBrush 2026/ZData/BrushPresets` or `Lightbox/Brushes` (local listing 2026-09-24) unless marked "not shipped". In the palette the brush file DamStandard.ZBP shows as Dam_Standard, but the item path `Brush:Dam_Standard` did not resolve through the SDK (README): a script selects it through `zb_ops.select_brush`.

## Navigation and review (C1)

- **Views.** Rotate with Shift for snapped views. P toggles perspective. F frames. Transform > PolyF shows the wireframe.
- **Materials.** MatCap Gray for form, SkinShade4 for folds (Pavlovich), Flat Color for silhouettes. A raking light comes from Light palette placement.
- **Before copy.** Tool > SubTool > Duplicate, then Tool > Geometry > X Position to park it beside the original (Kingslien judges beside a duplicate).
- **Upside down.** Rotate the model 180 degrees on screen (Costa).
- **Renders.** BPR with Shift+R; Redshift in Render > Redshift Renderer (scenario-zbrush-paint-render), the in-ZBrush route for the three-light SSS check: sharp detail must survive in the highlights.
- **Painter route.** Texture > Substance Bridge (2026.2): Send to Painter, Low & High, Auto-Bake Maps; Force UV Auto-Unwrap off when UVs exist.

## Masses and face (C2 to C4)

- **Block-in.**
  - Move is B, M, V: Dots, Z 51, Focal Shift 0.
  - Clay block-in: ClayBuildup is B, C, B, at Z 20 and Focal Shift -56 as a stand-in for RK_BallStylus (not shipped).
  - TrimAdaptive, Z 100, Focal Shift -83, for the forehead box.
  - Standard is B, S, T: Dots, Z 25, for the mouth line.
  - Inflat, Dots, Z 10, for the mouth-corner blend.
    (Kingslien frames.)
- **Carving.** Alt inverts ZAdd to ZSub.
- **Sculptris Pro.** The top-bar S icon, or Stroke > Sculptris Pro; delete levels first (Tool > Geometry > Del Lower and Del Higher). Brush > Depth > Imbed lowered for the nostril.
- **Masks.**
  - Hold Ctrl for MaskPen or MaskLasso; Ctrl+Alt removes mask.
  - Ctrl-click on the masked model blurs the mask (Pablo); Ctrl-click on empty canvas inverts it [verify].
  - Tool > Masking > BlurMask, Inverse, Clear.
  - Mask By Cavity, with its Blur and Intensity sliders and Cavity Profile curve; Mask By Smoothness (Range, Falloff); Mask PeaksAndValleys; Mask Ambient Occlusion.
- **Polygroup isolation.** Ctrl+Shift click isolates a polygroup; Control+W groups the visible part.
- **Auto-masking.** Brush > Auto Masking > Mask By Polygroups at 100 keeps a stroke inside the polygroup it starts on (shipped macro "Toggle Mask By Polygroups").
- **Deformation sliders.** Tool > Deformation: Offset (percent of the unit radius), Size (100 doubles), Inflat, Smooth, Polish, Rotate, Bend, SBend, Twist, Taper, Gravity. Click the X, Y, Z letters inside a slider to constrain it to world axes.

  - Hide the polygroups you do not need before entering (Costa); Auto Groups With UV gives one group per UDIM.
  - Enter a region: A over the mesh, with perspective off and aimed off the front axis (Costa).
