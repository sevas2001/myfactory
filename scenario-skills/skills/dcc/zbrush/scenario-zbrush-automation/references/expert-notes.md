# scenario-zbrush-automation expert notes

The depth behind SKILL.md: what each source says, where, and how it changes an agent's batch. Notes live in `notes/scripting/`, `notes/versions/`, `notes/maps-export/`, `notes/retopology-uv/`, `notes/pipeline/`; version facts in `sources/zbrush-version-deltas.md`. `[added]` marks this skill's own inference.

## 1. Control: one active script, plugins that keep it

- **marcus_civis** (ZBrushCentral, long-time ZScript and plugin author), 2014-02-17: "only one zscript/plugin can be active at a time, so if your zscript calls someting like UV Mapper control passes to UV Mapper and no more commands will run in your zscript." Same author, 2013-06-20 and 2019-04-22: a script handed to ZBrush on the command line only runs without a button when wrapped in `[If,1, ...]`, and should guard itself with a memory block so it runs once.
- **ijacobs** (ZBrushCentral, 2013-02-21): "as soon as my code clicks the Pre-Process All button in Decimation Master, my script exits because Decimation Master is a plugin that calls it's own scripts." He pre-processed by hand, then ran a per-SubTool decimate loop (target 75,000 points per SubTool for print: `% = 75000 / points * 100`).
- **cgside** (3D environment artist, "ZSCRIPT in Zbrush | Automate tasks", 2022): "we can't really run other plugins like the decimation master within our script by default" [00:06:56]; a free helper plugin with a two-run routine got around it [00:08:38]. Decimation target: points / 10, then / 1000 because the plugin field is in thousands [00:08:04].
  - His remesh recipe [00:01:43]-[00:02:51], scripted at [00:08:38]-[00:09:42]: save with a suffix, Merge Visible, fill white, duplicate and decimate; then Polygroups > Auto Groups (one group per separate piece), duplicate again, ZRemesher with Keep Groups, Divide 4 times, move to the top, save, hide the decimated SubTool, set the projection settings, ProjectAll. Keep Groups on Auto Groups is what makes the low follow each piece of a merged tile instead of bridging them. The toolkit runs it as `make_low(auto_groups=True)` (on the copy [added]) and it is on in `DEFAULT_PARAMS`.
  - "save it before projectile [ProjectAll] since it might crash the program this way we have some sort of backup" [00:02:19]: `zb_ops.project_all` refuses to run without a checkpoint, and `divide_project` saves once before its first pass.
- **MadPony** (plugin author, "What is ZScript", 2019): "one Z script will cancel out the other Z script" [00:00:35]; loading a recorded script removed the macro's button [00:05:52]. "Improving the Nudge Axis Plugin" [00:03:27]: a plugin's variables were wiped after another macro ran.
- **Maxon interfaces doc**: "Only one zscript (or plugin or macro) can be active at a time"; Python differs: "a single, persistent session".
- Agent consequence [added]: in Python the question is whether `zbc.press()` on a ZScript plugin returns to the caller at all (untested in 2026: scenario-zbrush-expert live_08, live_09, this skill's live_a02, live_a03). Until then every plugin press is a separate bridge call with a timeout, and the batch runner, not ZBrush, owns the loop.

## 2. Dialogs, notes and popups

- **TVeyes** (ZBrushCentral, 2015-04-11): "There is no reliable solution to using an external library to dismiss the note window based messages ZBrush displays." Merge Down's confirmation cannot be answered by a script because Space or Enter triggers the first Note button, which is Cancel (TVeyes, dargelos).
- **danvas** (2017-03-10): a studio dropped ZBrush from its render farm because Note dialogs when splitting polygroups could not be controlled.
- **BigRoyNL** (2024-03-07): "I can run zscripts from external, but have no way to detect whether they succeed or error"; plugin exports "seem to stop the current zscript execution".
- **m_adam** (Maxon SDK team, 2025-02-25): background-thread export from another program is likely impossible, and "if the export plugin, trigger a popup you are screwed".
- **ferdinand** (Maxon SDK team, 2025-03-11) on FBX: "You cannot escape any GUI associated with such call." **pablo31** (2026-02-04): `set_next_filename` before `Zplugin:FBX ExportImport:Import` still opened the file dialog; `Tool:SubTool:New Folder` opens a name prompt.
- **usd-portal** (baborub, tested on 2026.2): the USD Format plugin "opens its own file dialog and ignores FileNameSetNext".
- **Maxon shipped macros** (2026.2.1): confirmations are answered by holding a key during the press: `[IKeyPress,'2',[IPress,Tool:SubTool:Del All]]` (Delete All), `[IKeyPress,'1',[IPress,"Brush:Create:Create InsertMesh"]]` (Create Instance Subtool).
- **pocacola** (Maxon forum, 2026-04-21): Python `press_key` with modifier chords does not work; pressing a macro button that contains the `IKeyPress` worked.
- **SDK stub** (2026.1): `press_key` "Does not work, hidden for now"; `merge_undo` "Not implemented"; `message_*`, `ask_*` and `show_note(duration 0)` block until a click.
- Agent consequence: the dialog budget of a recipe is decided before the run (table in section 9); `has_next_filename()` after a file press is the cheap detector [added]; a modal Note is visible only in a screenshot, because ZBrush draws Notes inside its canvas, not as OS windows [added: System Events lists OS windows only].

## 3. Files without dialogs

- **Command reference** (FileNameSetNext): "Pre-sets the file name that will be used in the next Save/Load action"; `FileNameHasNext` tests whether it is still pending. Python: `set_next_filename`, `has_next_filename`, `get_last_used_filename` (returns a full path despite its name, SDK system doc).
- **MadPony** ("Tools and Folders", 2019): `FileNameSetNext` before `Tool:Save As` names the saved tool [00:02:51]; without it the tool takes its first SubTool's name [00:03:48].
- **Maxon example ex_mod_subtool_export** (Javier Edo, 2025): loop SubTools, skip unless status bit 0x01, name from `get_active_tool_path().rsplit('/')[-1]`, `set_next_filename`, `press("Tool:Export")`, `sys.exit(not exported)`.
- **usd-portal**: folder-aware visibility (eye 0x1 and folder 0x2); `.GoZ` by path "reliably carries UVs + polypaint"; OBJ is the reliable import; import onto the PolyMesh3D star, never SimpleBrush; Duplicate is "not found" outside Edit mode; textures need unique file names or ZBrush adds "(1)".
- **Paul Gaboury** (Maxon, #AskZBrush echGh0tZEts, 2022): OBJ cannot keep every SubTool with its name in one file [00:00:34]; FBX can, through its options dialog [00:01:06]; check by re-importing onto the PolyMesh3D star [00:01:42].
- **Maxon SDK environment doc**: the working directory is the app folder; since 2026.1 ZBrush does not write into its install (interfaces doc "Important Information for Users"): absolute paths outside the install only.

## 5. Learning paths

- **Maxon ZScript manual**: "do the thing you're interested in while recording a zscript of your actions... open this in a text editor and examine it"; "To find the button path for any item on the interface, place the cursor over the item and hold down Ctrl."
- **MadPony** ("What is ZScript" [00:04:40]-[00:05:17]): the Ctrl+hover path equals the recorded `IPress` line.
- **Pavlovich** (Workshop 45, 2018): recorded ZRepeat It scripts are editable text ("you can go through here and you can edit it" [01:02:07]); Ctrl+Alt+click any button to give it a hotkey [01:04:24].
- **Maxon SDK quickstart**: Python Scripting > New Macro and End Macro record Python; End Macro opens a save dialog; loading the file places a button instead of running it.
- **SDK API overview**: item paths ignore case and spaces; picker items (brushes, tools, materials) resolve by name without opening the picker.
- **Project Activity log** (README, 05:20 log): ZBrush writes every `IPress`/`ISet` with its canonical path, including plugin sliders at startup (`ISet, "Zplugin:3D Print Hub:X(mm)", 25.4`); the agent reads new lines after a human click [added use as an oracle].

## 6. Per-SubTool repetition and names

- **Pavlovich** (Workshop 45): ZRepeat It "you can record ... and then name it and then you can tell it I want to apply what I just did to this single visible sub tool or all visible sub tools or all sub tools" [00:37:30]; demo DynaMesh 64, Blur 0 [00:42:53]. Not shipped in 2026.2.1: a Python loop replaces it.
- **MadPony** ("Selecting SubTools" [00:01:03]-[00:03:10]): names repeat and "a duplicate will always give you the same ID"; work by index, re-read after any reorder; the ItemInfo title ends with a period (strip 2 characters, usd-portal).
- **MadPony** ("Renaming SubTools" [00:00:34]; "Moving SubTools" [00:01:06]): `ToolSetPath` renames only the top SubTool; move it up while MoveUp is enabled, rename, move back.
- **davide** (Maxon forum 2026-09-10): SubTool and folder management "are high on the list" for a future API; no date.
- **GoZ docs** ("Restrictions"): unique Tool and SubTool names "including between all the loaded Tools", no spaces or non-alphanumeric characters; PolyMesh3D only.

## 7. Plugins

- **Decimation Master doc**: options, then Pre-process (progressive meshes from 100 to 0 % on disk), then Decimate; the result reflects the model at pre-process time; unique SubTool names required; a new tool with a cached name reuses stale caches; Keep UVs +50 % memory; quality 40 to 100 % near identical, 2 % still good, 1 % degrades; killing the plugin process leaves ZBrush alive but the calling ZScript keeps focus, and ESC stops it (Troubleshooting). Up to 100M polygons since 2021.6.3 (version deltas).
- **Ian Robinson** (Maxon, #AskZBrush bVX9utHc_ZI, 2022): Use and Keep Polypaint "by default this is turned off" [00:01:17]; presets pre-process and decimate in one click [00:02:15].
- **Joseph Drust** (Pixologic, #AskZBrush mRfA_WDvvrg, 2018): polygroups are lost; Unweld Groups Border [00:02:35], Freeze Borders and a preset [00:03:14], Auto Groups [00:03:50], Weld Points [00:04:30], divide to check [00:05:04].
- **UV Master doc**: a UV creator, not an editor; 100k to 150k faces maximum, up to 5 minutes at 150k; Work on Clone whenever there are levels or polypaint (clone is a new CL_ tool); Copy UVs, Paste UVs between same-topology meshes; polygroups speed it up and reduce cuts; Attract from Ambient Occlusion is the stroke-free seam hint; control maps are bound to the tool name. UV Master with Polygroups fixed in 2026.2.0 (release notes).
- **Multi Map Exporter doc**: Create All Maps opens a save dialog; aborting with ESC can lose UVs, back up first; Mid 0 and Scale 1 for 32-bit displacement, 0.5 and Get Scale's lower value for 16-bit; Flip V flips all maps; UDIM naming options.
- **Joseph Drust** (#AskZBrush n0qqpwvn-jA, 2017): a ZBrush map compares the selected level with the highest level of the same SubTool, "you can't have a subtool that is your low resolution version and then a subtool that is your high resolution version" [00:01:14]; 2zDAtaQqwh8 (2020): baking from a high level keeps only micro detail [00:02:53].
- **SDK stub**: `create_normal_map(..., local_coordinates=False)` is world space by default; tangent needs True.

## 8. GoZ, Maya and Blender

- **GoZ docs**: GoZ, All, Visible, R; ZBrush sends the lowest subdivision level; maps travel only if loaded in the Tool's map slots; topology changes raise a reprojection prompt that "can be time consuming" and "may alter a little bit the quality"; Preferences > GoZ > Import as SubTool.
- **GoZ SDK** ("not really a true SDK"): the shared folder `/Users/Shared/Pixologic`; object identifier = full path without extension; `GoZ_ObjectList.txt`; `GoZBrushFromApp` opens listed objects in the running ZBrush; `GoZ_Info.txt` flip flags per app.
- **Local files** (2026-09-24): Maya's `GoZ_Info.txt` sets EXPORT/IMPORT_FLIP_Y and _Z and NORMAL_MAP_FLIP_VERT to TRUE; Maya's `GoZ_Config.txt` points at `/Applications/Autodesk/maya2017` (no Maya installed); the Maya side loads the `gozMaya` plug-in and opens command port 5555; `ZResources/DXFStar.GoZ` confirms the binary layout (header, name, flags 5001, points 10001, faces 20001, material 2, 16-byte end).
- **FlippedNormals** (Morten Jaeger, Henning Sanden, 2020): GoB is "by far the fastest way"; GoZ exports "from the lowest subdivision level" [00:04:02]; delete lower levels before sending if polypaint resolution matters [00:06:01]; pack and unpack textures out of the public folder [00:08:15]; FBX into Blender at scale 1000 [00:11:21].
- **usd-portal**: GoZ UVs match USD, but an imported Texture Map needs a V flip; OBJ vertex colors are decoded sRGB to linear, so pre-encode.
- **Laura Gallagher** (Outgang, ex Lead Character Artist at Eidos Montreal): ZBrush has only units [00:04:27]; keep XYZ Size near 2 [00:28:23]; Export Scale converts to real units and an OBJ import sets it [00:24:03]; offsets are in internal units [00:33:40]; Unify is unsafe on characters with layers and morph targets [00:27:16].

## 9. Dialog budget for batches

| Step                                              | Modal risk                          | Plan                                                                       |

| GoZ first press, GoZ return with new topology     | app chooser, reprojection prompt    | `.GoZ` by path; import as a new SubTool and Project All                    |
| Quit with unsaved work                            | save prompt                         | `zb_launch.stop` answers No when unlocked, else SIGTERM                    |

## 10. ZScript to Python (for reading macros and forum answers)

## 12. Projection safety and the shared interpreter (added 2026-09-24 from the Z7 grade)

- **FlippedNormals** (Henning Sanden, Morten Jaeger, ex-MPC and ex-Framestore, Zp07GW3rND0, 2018): at the highest level, Store Morph Target, then a New Layer, then Project All; "It's important that you do all of this on the highest level" [00:02:13]. Repair busted areas with the Morph brush, not smoothing: "you're never gonna be able to smooth these kind of things out properly" [00:06:36]. Local fix: mask, invert, project again [00:09:27].
- **Joseph Drust** (Pixologic, #AskZBrush nxMYYsyJt3o): Dist 0.1; the small default causes "90 percent" of Project All artifacts [00:02:19]. Set explicitly by `zb_ops.project_all`.
- **Maxon SDK Style Guide and examples**: one persistent interpreter; the script folder is not on `sys.path`; insert a folder only for the import, then remove it and pop the modules (ex_mod_curve_lightning); `random.seed = 42` breaks `random.seed` until restart. `freeze(fn)` for heavy sequences ("Frozen will be most of the UI, but things like progress bars will still work"), `show_actions(0)` before scripted presses (not needed for `set`).
- **Maxon SDK modeling reference**: `get_polymesh3d_volume()` and `is_polymesh3d_solid()` are one call each; the toolkit gates every destructive op on them (python_sdk digest delta 22: catch a collapsed or exploded remesh). Bands are [added].
