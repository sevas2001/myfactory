# Critique rubric (scenario-maya-fx)

Judge the cache, never the live solve (SARKAMARI RhAxSgPpZww [00:19:32]). Every item has a measurable side (run it) and a visual side (render or playblast it, open the image, write what you see). An item passes only when both pass or the report states the exception and why (SARKAMARI accepts small artifacts that motion blur hides in camera, [00:37:46]). Bars marked [added] are this skill's defaults; the expert standard is the visual one.

## 0. Before looking at motion

## 6. The report

State: versions of every file delivered; the numbers above with their bars; which renders or playblasts were looked at and what they showed; exceptions accepted and why; what was not verified (every [verify] path used). "Looks fine" without an image path is not a verdict.
