# Maya FX (Nucleus, Bifrost, MASH, caches)

An expert FX TD fixes scale and inputs before touching a knob, changes few settings one at a time, never judges a live solve, and proves the result on the cache in numbers (penetration, stretch, pops, convergence) and in renders from the shot camera. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-maya-expert (execution channel, review loop, 2027 version traps).

**Status (2026-09-24):** Maya 2027 is not installed. The pure-Python layer of [`scripts/mx_fx.py`](scripts/mx_fx.py) passed offline (`tests/code/maya-fx/test_fx_offline.py`); every Maya call is **not yet run in Maya**; names marked [verify] are answered by `job_00_fx_probe.py` (`python3 tests/code/maya-fx/run_all.py`).

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Scale before anything.** Nucleus and Bifrost compute in meters whatever Maya's unit: Space Scale and `scene_units_in_meters` 0.01 in a cm scene, or a 182 cm character is 182 m to the solver (2027 Help; SARKAMARI [00:29:22]; Stamatelos [00:30:21]). MPM `detail_size` is in meters, so a unit change silently changes resolution (Gast [00:07:29]).
- **Never simulate the production mesh.** Duplicate the skinned body and garment, drive the duplicates with a blend shape at weight 1, hide the originals (SARKAMARI [00:10:04]).
- **Give the solver a clean start.** Hold 25 frames, blend 25 frames into the first pose, action at 0, Nucleus start -50 (SARKAMARI [00:05:26]); Julan: A-pose at 0, walk by 24.
- **Substeps before stiffness.** Collision iterations below the substep count do nothing; high stretch resistance at low substeps cannot converge (2027 Help, Tips). SARKAMARI's remaining penetration vanished at 30 substeps and 35 iterations, with Space Scale moved to 0.25 in the same pass [00:29:22] [00:29:57].
- **Cache, judge the cache, render the cache.** nCache before every playblast; the render scene holds Alembics only (SARKAMARI [00:19:32], [00:40:07]).
- **Bifrost fails silently.** Unpulled outputs are never computed, empty arrays are valid data, mismatched arrays truncate (Jason E3aOt5wuvoo [00:22:49]; Nordenstam [00:38:11]; graph doc). A sim solves only forward from its own start frame: default 1, and it must exist in the timeline (sim guide; Nordenstam [00:56:23]).
- **Do not simulate what you do not need.** Start a snowball at the collider with its impact velocity (Gast [00:55:18]); layer garments through Alembic colliders (SARKAMARI [00:32:06]); coarse background sources (Stamatelos [00:21:25]).
- **One change per run, logged** (Jason cd3HgvM8sXg [00:21:43]); `mx_fx.set_attrs` returns the log.

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shot range, fps, action start | pre-roll, cache range, handles                                   | 24 fps, pre-roll 50 frames before the action             |
| Character delivery            | sim duplicates need a skinned or cached body                     | referenced rig or Alembic from scenario-maya-animation   |
| Linear unit and real size     | solver scale                                                     | cm, real size checked with `mx_fx.scale_report`          |

## Workflow

1. **Scale and inputs.** `mx_fx.scale_report(meshes, expected_size_m=...)`; if the model is not real size, fix the asset (Julan [00:02:02]). Record any deliberate non-physical scale (SARKAMARI's 0.25 on a 182 cm character) with `art_choice=True`. GATE: no error line.
2. **Pick the system** (options keyed to the brief):

   | Effect                                     | Default              | Alternative and when                                                                                                   |
   | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Cape, garment on a character               | nCloth               | Bifrost MPM cloth when it must tear, live in a Bifrost graph, or go to a game via USD (Jason hmuWr2nWSms, yo6y7cANfX0) |
   | Dust puff, smoke, mist                     | Bifrost Aero         | add MPM sand or snow for dirt clumps; nParticles for grit (doc-level only)                                             |
   | Snow, sand, mud impact                     | MPM granular         | none in the sources                                                                                                    |
   | Scatter, crowds of copies, motion graphics | MASH (Repro)         | Instancer for speed; Bifrost `scatter_points` for USD point instancers                                                 |
   | Liquids                                    | `basic_liquid_graph` | legacy Bifrost Fluids is gone                                                                                          |

3. **Prepare cloth inputs.** Topology gate `mx_fx.cloth_topology_verdict(mx_audit.audit(garment), expected_border_loops=1)`: evenly spaced quads (cross links need quads), manifold, single-sided, holes sealed (SARKAMARI [00:03:05]). Pre-roll `mx_fx.add_preroll(ctrls, action_start, rest=bind_pose)`; duplicates at the bind frame with `mx_fx.sim_duplicate`. GATE: verdict clean, the duplicate follows the original within 0.01 cm.
4. **Build.**
   - nCloth: `mx_fx.build_cloth_rig(garment_SIM, body_SIM, action_start, preset=...)`: one nucleus, Space Scale for the unit, start at the pre-roll, first pass substeps 10 / iterations 12, preset values, thin cloth and collider. Pin a cape collar with an input-attract lock map (value 1 plus Input Attract Method "Lock values of 1.0 or greater", Collide Last Threshold 1.0, [added] recipe from the doc) or Point to Surface with Exclude Collisions (SARKAMARI [00:23:40]), members on the input mesh (output-mesh members risk a DG loop, doc; `point_to_surface(..., cloth=)` rewrites them). GATE: `rig["verdict"]` has no error.
   - Bifrost: start from `basic_*_graph` and Explode (Stamatelos [00:39:07]); script it with `mx_fx.BifrostGraph` (logs every VNN call) or reuse a GUI Echo All Commands log. Hide what you bring in (Jason). Open or flat emitters (ring, ground patch) need Shell, closed ones Solid (Stamatelos [00:10:40]). Set the sim's start frame. GATE: `aero_source_verdict(...)` on `emitter_facts(mesh)` and `sim_range_verdict(...)` clean; every output pulled; point or voxel count above 0 on every frame.
   - MASH: `mx_fx.mash_network(sources, geometry="Repro")` [verify MASH.api]; unit-size sources (Waters). GATE: `mx_fx.mash_cache_reasons(mx_fx.mash_inventory(waiter))` read.
5. **First pass cheap, then cache.** Low resolution (Aero detail 0.1, cloth first pass), frames evaluated in order from the start frame (`mx_fx.run_sim`, `step_frames`), every frame played in the GUI. After a `geo_detail_size` or `time_step_size` change, or a compound created or exploded, re-run from the start (sim guide). GATE: nothing non-finite, no empty frame.
6. **Measure and look.** `rep = mx_fx.sim_report(cloth_out, body_SIM, start, end, action_start=..., thickness=...)`, `rep["convergence"] = mx_fx.convergence_test(...)`, `mx_fx.sim_verdict(rep, budget_spf=...)` (adds the doc's Timing Output gate: solve seconds per frame against the brief). Then look: headless `mx_review.review([cloth_out, body_SIM], out, views=("side","back","threequarter"), modes=("clay",), focus=fixed)` at the action start, the peak and the last frame; GUI `mx_review.playblast` from the shot camera; volumes with `mx_fx.volume_review` (Arnold, tricubic). Judge with [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md).
7. **Triage in this order** (never stiffen first): scale; start state (pre-roll, Push Out, Crossover Push with Trapped Check); substeps with iterations above; thickness down, Self Collide Width Scale up; stretch and compression together (SARKAMARI [00:24:50]); Bend Solver High Quality for flips; Collide Last Threshold 1.0 when attract or rigidity drags cloth through; lower Strength on popping constraints; "frame change too large" means play from the start or cache (2027 Help). Leftover pokes: a sculpted corrective on the cached mesh, or accepted under blur (SARKAMARI [00:37:12]). Aero detail: 2027 sharpening (`aero_refinement_settings`, low amount), adaptivity bounds, or `post_refine_aero` on the cache (frames in order, original sources and colliders) before lowering detail size everywhere (sim guide).
8. **Final cache and deliver.** Final pass settings, nCache from the nucleus start (`ncache_verdict`: mcc stops at 2 GB, use mcx; positions only, so the cloth transform must stay still), disable the nucleus, Alembic of cloth and body over the shot range with UVs and color sets (`mx_fx.alembic_export`); Bifrost `file_cache` with only the properties the renderer needs; a cache-only render scene. GATE: `mx_fx.alembic_check` and `file_sequence_report` clean, a look at the cache.

## Quality gates

- **In code:** `cloth_topology_verdict`, `scale_report`, `nucleus_verdict` (iterations above substeps, scale, pre-roll), `sim_verdict` (zero penetrating vertices after the action, stretch under 1.10 x rest [added], pops, settle, standoff, convergence, solve time), `alembic_check` (range, one mesh, vertex count), `file_sequence_report` (every frame, no runaway growth), `sim_range_verdict` (cache and review reach the shot end), `ncache_verdict`, `mash_cache_reasons`, `overlaps` (instances), `sprite_framing`, `usd_check_unreal`.
- **Visual:** cloth weight and swing against reference at the character's speed, folds, armpit and back view with smooth preview, collar stiffness, garment stays on the shoulders, penetration visible in the shot camera or hidden by blur (SARKAMARI [00:36:39], [00:37:46]); smoke rises, breaks up, dissipates, no disappearing voxels, stepped trails or collider gap, judged in the render (Stamatelos; sim guide); MPM crack pattern, piece size, debris; MASH jitter while scrubbing a deforming mesh (Waters [00:03:53]).

## Handoffs

- **Receives from scenario-maya-animation:** a referenced rig or an Alembic of the character, the approved shot range and fps, bind pose available (for the pre-roll), `validate(profile="shot")` clean. Asks for pre-roll room before the action if the timeline starts on it.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-lighting-rendering:** a new scene version `<shot>_fx_render_v###.ma` holding only caches; Alembics `<asset>_<fx>_v###.abc` (UVs, color sets, shot range plus handles) and the body they collided with (SARKAMARI [00:39:34]); VDB sequences with only density and velocity (plus temperature for fire); Bifrost caches `.bob` for resumable work; `sim_report.json`, the review sheet or playblast looked at, and what was not verified. Units cm, Y-up; frame range stated.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-pipeline-scripting (games):** flipbook passes (emission, volume_direct, tangent-space normals) with `sprite_framing` clean, baked Alembic or USD meshes checked by `usd_check_unreal`, low resolution for engines (Jason yo6y7cANfX0 [00:05:09]).
- **Asks scenario-maya-rigging** for a closed, simplified collider proxy when the render body is open or heavy.

## Maya 2027 notes

- Bifrost 3.0 (3.1.0.8 in 2027.1) is always installed; async evaluation; Batch Execute and Write State; node search. Legacy Bifrost Fluids is gone: `basic_liquid_graph`.
- MPM 2027: `link_collider_detail`, `max_voxel_movement` retries, `lag_colliders`, `initial_firmness`.
- Bifrost doc names disagree (`simulate_liquid(s)`, `liquid_solver_settings` vs `_properties`, `geo_volume_mode` given to both Solid/Shell and Absolute/Relative): read ports with `BifrostGraph.find_port`.
- nCloth Bend Solver default is High Quality. Cached Playback can cache dynamics in memory; files on disk remain the handoff.
- MASH: Signal replaced Noise and Trig, Strength replaced Mute, nodes act on TRS, Repro is the default, Delay offsets transform animation.
- Alembic is Ogawa only. AbcExport's `-j` string splits on spaces [added, verify]: `alembic_export` writes to a space-free temp path first.
