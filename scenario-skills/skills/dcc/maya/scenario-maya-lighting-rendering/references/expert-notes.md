# Expert notes: lighting and rendering

The depth behind SKILL.md, grouped by expert, with timestamps (video id [hh:mm:ss]) or book and doc sections. Source files: `notes/lighting-rendering/` (both digests and every note) and `notes/lookdev/_digest_lookdev_arnold_materials.md` for the product-shot lessons. Keys as in `sources.md`. [added] marks this skill's own formalizations; every number without a cite is [added] and is a starting point to calibrate.

Caveat on independence: Tanzillo's critique (TZ-C) and the SIGGRAPH talk (KT) share Michael Tanzillo, so their agreement is one school (Blue Sky). Brejon (video and book) is the independent voice and quotes Animal Logic, Ilion, DreamWorks and Pixar lighters. No source gives numeric key-to-fill ratios ("everything about ratios is qualitative", Brejon book note): the stop targets in `MOOD_RATIO_STOPS` are ours.

## Michael Tanzillo, Lighting Critique (TZ-C, 5X4-uavfVgA, 2024)

Senior Lighting TD, Blue Sky Studios; co-author of "Lighting for Animation". The only critique-format source: the order and vocabulary a lead uses on a finished frame.

- **Order of a pass over a frame:** watch as a viewer; compare with the artist's own reference and name what it does structurally; squint; fix the value structure; redirect the eye; offer the alternative read; check physical plausibility; hunt technical artifacts; paint over to prove the note [00:00:39] [00:08:06] [00:11:53] [00:08:38] [00:12:27] [00:13:34] [00:05:53] [00:03:24] [00:16:27].
- **Squint test:** "if I kind of just like squint my eyes to the image my eye just really wants to go up into here" [00:11:53]. Bright overhead sources drag the eye up; fix with leading lines down, a bigger pool of light at the subject, darker windows and highlights high in frame [00:12:27] [00:13:00]. Code: `saliency` + `focus_check`, finding `eye_path` with the "pulled UP" message.
- **Back-to-front black levels:** "we want the most lifted back here we want midtone values here and then the darkest here in the foreground" [00:08:38]; unimportant background can lose contrast entirely [00:11:53]; atmospheric falloff even in stylized films (Spider-Verse) [00:15:20]. Code: `depth_structure` on Z, subject excluded.
- **A lone hue is an eye magnet:** "the only red element in this very very cool blue scene" [00:14:39]. Code: `isolated_hues`.
- **Physical signatures inside a frame:** window light diffuses with distance, so far shadows cannot be razor sharp; enlarge the light [00:05:53] [00:06:58]; rays from one distant source run parallel [00:12:27]; skin needs oily specular on the lit side [00:06:26]; SSS "some, not much" [00:07:31].
- **Local fix under a liberal contract:** a separate key light-linked to a second character to match the first one's wrap [00:06:58].
- **Set dressing for light:** primitive blockers inside unseen rooms break a uniform window glow [00:18:07]; practicals need a hot core [00:18:39].
- **Technical tells:** dark outline on DOF edges (a multiplied edge in Nuke) [00:03:24]; a background staying sharp while the foreground racks focus [00:03:58]; a wall rendering pure black means a broken material [00:08:38].
- He labels his late notes "very nitpicky" [00:19:12]: structure first, polish last.

## Jasmine Katatikarn and Michael Tanzillo, Secrets From A Lighting Artist (KT, iYTjebUHX9o, SIGGRAPH 2020)

Senior Lighting TDs, Blue Sky (about ten films each).

- **Three goals for every decision:** mood, visual shaping, directing the eye to the most important element [00:04:18] [00:42:33]; the first question is "what is the story I am trying to tell?" [00:16:50]; the target is the story action (the hand touching the nose in How to Train Your Dragon), not the face by default [00:15:49] [00:16:21].
- **Mood levers:** value, position, hue, saturation, softness, color psychology [00:04:40]; hue alone moves the Epic deer shot from romance to documentary to alien threat [00:05:11]; soft and shadowless reads happy, high contrast dread (Doris Day vs Elizabeth Taylor) [00:06:14]; warm skin is life, cool light on warm skin drains it (Incredibles office) [00:07:47]; food must be warm [00:08:19].
- **Shaping:** light-to-dark or warm-to-cool falloff across every form; "nothing in the real world is a constant tone" [00:10:11] [00:12:20]; Rembrandt key about 45 degrees to the side and slightly above, the lit triangle on the far cheek [00:11:15] [00:11:47].
- **Directing the eye with contrast pairs:** light over dark, dark over light, warm over cool, complementary hues, saturated over desaturated, detailed over abstract [00:13:22] [00:13:54] [00:14:26]; the Piper shadow was painted in for the story [00:13:54]; 7 frames is enough for a read [00:13:22].
- **Brighten by darkening the surround:** pushing the subject clips it; after darkening the background the character "looks so much brighter" with unchanged values (simultaneous contrast) [00:29:59] [00:30:31] [00:31:04]. Code: `separation`, `subject_clipping`, and the fix text of both.
- **Demo order (hero version):** fill value first, then key for Rembrandt shaping, rim for separation, specular pass for fleshy skin, falloff across the couch, eye dings, vignette, glow [00:27:52] [00:28:24] [00:28:55] [00:29:26] [00:31:04].
- **Hard-luck version:** frontal top-down key, cooled light, haze behind the character to separate a cool figure from a greenish set [00:32:08] [00:32:39] [00:35:50]; one RGB pass carries three interactive lights [00:33:43]; two keyed spotlights close enough to blow out fake a passing car [00:34:15] [00:35:18].
- **Pipeline:** the master lighter lights 3 or 4 key shots with the art director and paint-overs; shot lighters inherit the rig in packets and match "in its own way" [00:50:00] [00:50:32]; a lighter owns whole shots [00:25:42]; about 3 to 4 days of rough passes before first dailies, 9 to 11 approved shots in a strong week [00:53:11] [00:53:44].
- **Lighting vs comp:** get 90% of the look in the beauty because shaping cannot be faked in comp [00:45:39]; triage notes: "the key needs to be moved" is lighting, "lift that fill by 10" is comp [00:47:19]; build for predictable notes (interactive lights as separate passes) [00:44:14]; the cheapest solution that hits the note wins (cars as roto shapes on a released film) [00:41:16].
- **Judge in the cut:** a beautiful shot that does not match its neighbors is rejected [00:18:25] [00:18:56].

## Chris Brejon, Master and Shot Lighting, Night Bar (BR, PHskvc6WYWI, 2020)

Lighting supervisor (Illumination Mac Guff, Animal Logic, Weta, Framestore); Guerilla Render on screen, so no settings port.

- **The contract first:** Illumination is "very conservative" (masters made universal), Animal Logic treats "almost every shot [as] a master on its own" [00:00:32] [00:01:06]; his own verdict "Over continuity, I choose cinematography" [01:07:51]. Allowed shot tweaks in his exercise: exposure, position and rotation, on and off [00:37:17]; color too on Lego Batman [00:37:51].
- **References before any light:** two days lost lighting without one [00:08:13]; posterize a film frame into key, wrap, rim and core zones, the core "is not a light" [00:09:19]; the wide reference showed the two characters keyed from opposite directions [00:09:53].
- **Test shading:** ACES view, everything on a linear 0.18 gray [00:04:21] [00:04:54].
- **Practicals first; dark characters are good news** [00:19:46]; practicals at their physical places with IES patterns, "too simple, too poor" without them [00:17:37] [00:18:10]; they license the dramatic lights: a strong key with nothing motivating it looks weird [00:22:30]. "Reality is boring" [00:22:30].
- **Dramatic lights one by one, each rendered on all four shots** [00:25:14]: key = "the main shaping light... not necessarily the strongest" [00:23:36], a small area source for sharp shadows [00:27:59]; wrap (Deakins' term) "a bit front lit, lower in exposure, and a bit more saturated", about twice the key's size [00:26:54] [00:27:59]; rim outlines and faces the camera; a rim that only catches hair is wasted [00:27:59] [00:30:11]; top light reads natural, from below scary [00:30:43]; volumetric lights are the only linked lights [00:31:14].
- **No light on the camera side facing the characters:** "we don't want them to lose contrast" [00:13:46]. Code: the wrap is pushed at least 30 degrees off the lens axis [added threshold].
- **Volumetrics from the first render**, adding them later "looks like crap" [00:33:29] [00:34:01].
- **Shot lighting:** sfumato on the CU [00:38:24]; counterchange, "when I have light in the background, I have shadow in the foreground and vice versa" [00:38:56]; never dark on dark on a face [00:40:02]; a bright object between two characters ties them [00:41:07]; foreground dark and contrasty, generally [00:29:06]; areas left dark on purpose [00:42:13].
- **Color last and split by medium:** orange and teal between volume and surfaces so they do not blend to gray [00:47:40] [00:49:19].
- **Comp checks:** LPE layers sum exactly to the beauty, "It's mathematic" [00:59:41]; merge plus on RGB, not RGBA, or alpha accumulates [01:00:14]; carry the grade back as a multiplier on the light color (gain 0.2 0.5 2 on 0.6 0.42 0.13 gives 0.12 0.21 0.26) [01:02:57] [01:03:30]. Code: `check_sums`, `grade_to_light(mode="multiply")` reproduces the example exactly (offline test).
- **Groups:** 30 lights, 9 light AOVs by category [01:12:25].
- **DOF in 3D:** "you will spend more time tweaking defocus in Nuke" [00:54:45]; bokeh needs energy (small bright sources) [00:55:51].

## Chris Brejon, CG Cinematography, chapters 6, 8, 8.5 (BR-B)

- **Continuity is cultural:** "as long as the shots belong to the same world" (ch6 § Continuity); audiences forgive a moved key between cuts but notice a signature feature (a strong rim) that comes and goes (Walvoord; ch6 § Hugo, § Speed Racer). The Lion King team moved the sun on virtually every shot (ch6 § The Lion King). Code: `compare_frames` group energy in stops per character's rim [added].
- **Balance:** "You guys have too many light sources at the same intensity. You cannot pick one above the others" (Freckelton, ch6 § Balance); a rim as strong as the key is the most common failure; symmetric lighting only when the art direction is symmetric (ch6 § Planet 51, § Lego Batman). Code: `group_levels` gap, `rim_equals_key`, `symmetric_face`.
- **Contrast, negative space, vignetting:** the eye goes to the most contrasted area (ch6 § Contrast); a white sheet behind a poorly lit head can beat complex lighting (ch6 § Hannibal); darker foreground, brighter far background (ch6 § Negative space); fade lights at the periphery with blockers, a default directional "would blast everything equally" (ch6 § Vignetting); place the lamp where you want attention (ch6 § Matrix Reloaded).
- **Shot lighting procedure (ch8):** watch the full sequence and answer the question list first (§ Watch the full sequence); render the rig out of the box and agree a direction with the lead; a 15-frame shot does not deserve a week (§ Do a first pass); optimize because each artist owns the shot's render time, but check a "useless" light's reflections before deleting it: with quadratic decay diffuse falls off faster than reflection (§ Optimization); widest shots first, close-ups last (§ Close up lighting); one master per camera axis (§ Start with practical lights); break the rig two or three times a day (§ Master lighting and its limits); constrain lights only to keep an effect on a moving character, never practicals (§ Constrain of lights, § Constrain in The Star).
- **Character lighting (ch8.5):** five portrait rules (Ilion): no harsh shadows, no flat lighting, no black areas, one shadow direction, do not cut the face in half (§ Introduction); light upstage, Munich turned the sun in every shot to avoid lighting downstage (§ Lighting upstage and downstage); wrap "is really the art of making multiple lights appear to be one light" (Walvoord, § Dramatic Character lighting); never ambient (§ Ambient lighting); top light supports the environment, dropped for low-key looks (§ Top light); "I never create special lights for the eyes"; highlight present unless the character is dead or defeated, sharp for anger, bigger and dimmer for thinking (§ Eyes lighting, § Eyes and psychology); name natural and practical lights by what they are, dramatic lights by what they do (§ Natural Lighting vocabulary).

## Chris Brejon, CG Cinematography, chapters 1, 1.5, 9: color and comp (BRJ-CM)

- **The color workflow is the first project decision** (Ch.1 § The first and most important decision); scene-linear is compulsory and viewing it without an S-shaped view transform is wrong (Ch.1 § Scene-Linear workflow, § Display-linear confusion).
- **Without tone mapping you over-rig:** you lower burnt lights, lose GI and SSS, add lights, "and this is how you end up with a complicated rig of 50 lights" (Ch.1 § A simple visual example).
- **ACEScg is different, not better;** never render in ACES2065-1; ACES 1.x output transforms skew saturated blues toward magenta and clip saturated volumetrics (Ch.1.5 § A closer look at ACEScg, § Why ACEScg?, § Hue skews and Gamut Clipping).
- **After a rendering-space change, delete the TX files** (Ch.1.5 § Cornell box example).
- **EXR half for beauty and AOVs, float for Z and P, DWAB for size** (Ch.1 § Format). This skill writes zip by default because the pure reader and every comp package read it [added choice].
- **Clamps:** indirect clamp no lower than 10 in his experience, pixel clamp 30 to 50 in studios; low clamps desaturate blooms (Ch.1 § Range; Ch.9 § Exposure and clamping example).
- **Exposure QC:** go down and up five stops, find the brightest pixel, squint, thumbnail, flip (Ch.9). Code: `exposure_bracket`, `exr_sanity`.
- **Glow as an exposure check:** "Don't arbitrarily tweak the glow, tweak your light's exposure instead" (Ch.9 § Exposure control by Lens effect).
- **Nail it in CG:** "the more you leave to compensate in comp, the cheaper the movie will tend to look"; roll comp balance back into the lights; repeated issues go back to the source (shoji screens fixed in surfacing because a grade cannot brighten GI or reflections); animated lights belong in LPEs (Ch.9 § The only rule, § LPE and AOVs, § Shoji screens, § What we SHOULD not do in 3d).

## Arvid Schneider, Cinematic Lighting Techniques (ARV-L, 2SDDFiQQH5g, 2020)

VFX lighting supervisor (ILM, Image Engine alumnus).

- **Physical size and distance:** tiny sources make "painting" reflections; lights hugging the subject burn out and break when it moves [00:02:50] [00:03:24].
- **Key strongest; tone down competitors** [00:02:50] [00:06:51] (the decider against Brejon's "main shaping light" is in SKILL.md).
- **Exposure 15 to 20 in his cm scene** [00:03:58]; this skill's `exposure_for_target` formula lands in that range at 1 to 2 m [added derivation]; spread is the softbox grid, default 1 fully open [00:04:30] [00:05:02]; Kelvin for warm and cool [00:05:08].
- **Name by role:** `lgt_key_01`, `lgt_rim_01`, `lgt_bounce_01`, `lgt_kick_01` [00:06:16] [00:12:25]; keep alternative setups as toggled groups [00:10:45] [00:11:19].
- **Cool and warm contrast between key and rim** is "the most seen way", match the reference [00:07:24]; a subtle up-light card helps read the expression [00:08:31] [00:09:37]; small source harsh, big source soft [00:09:04].
- **Blocker to shape falloff** instead of re-aiming [00:14:30]; barndoors are spot-only in Arnold (LGT), use blockers on area lights [added from doc].
- "It's super important that everything has roundness to it" [00:18:21].

## Arvid Schneider, 12 Tips for Faster and Beautiful Renders (ARV-T, XZfsqJ0_9go, 2020)

- **Less noise at the same samples is a faster render; find the noisy sampler first:** raising diffuse did nothing, one or two more light samples cleaned the frame; "no need at all to go crazy on your AA" [00:01:33] [00:03:38] [00:04:11]; kill diffuse and specular indirect first to see where the noise lives [00:04:44].
- **Ray depth is a visual A/B:** diffuse 4 for most interiors, test 6, keep the lower if equal; specular never above 2 unless glass panes or inter-reflecting metal [00:05:26] [00:05:59].
- **Samples multiply:** light samples down to 2 at AA 6 to 10 [00:07:12] (per-light advice now superseded by Global Light Sampling, still valid for the skydome).
- **HDRI resolution:** 1k usually, 4k max, 8k only for very reflective scenes; a 16k map changed only the visible background [00:07:54] [00:09:32].
- **Analytic lights over mesh lights and emission:** a cylinder area light replaced a tube mesh light, "amazing" noise difference [00:10:18] [00:10:51].
- **Reserve UI threads in GUI sessions** (-20 of 80) [00:13:05]; **pre-bake TX** with auto-convert off and use-existing on [00:14:13] [00:14:44]; stand-ins for heavy repeats [00:15:57].
- **Motion blur and DOF cost AA:** about 12 for motion blur, up to 20 for strong DOF, secondaries and light samples at 1; or Z and motion vector AOVs with instantaneous shutter for comp [00:18:50] [00:20:29] [00:21:35].
- **Denoise:** 6 s noisy plus denoise against 84 s brute force, "a bit too much blurring" in places [00:23:22] [00:26:04].

## Arvid Schneider, Realistic Car Render (ARV-C, cpMBRIWwghg, 2021): the product-shot lessons

Shading belongs to scenario-maya-lookdev; these are the lighting and finishing points.

- **Reflections are the tell and the product:** "just look at the reflections, are they perfectly straight" [00:35:49]; he recreated the reference's lights (a strong light and bonnet lights) before tuning the paint [00:36:21]. The skill turns this into `reflection_placement` and `plan_product_rig`.
- **Integration:** a shadow matte with the HDRI projected as its background, color-correct the plate not the lighting [00:49:49] [00:50:21]; AO multiply for contact [00:50:54].
- **Finishing:** "in CG it's always just too black": a subtle shadows lift (about 0.15), vignette, a warm bloom [00:52:51] [00:53:24]; denoise last in his session and do not erase the flakes [00:54:27]. The Arnold doc places the denoiser first in the imager chain (the order), Arvid's caution is about detail (the gate): `detail_loss`.

## J Hill, Hyper Realistic Character Rendering (JHILL, mpk6IurOWbs, 2022): portrait and product lighting

AAA lead character artist (Turtle Rock).

- "To make lights soft just like the real world it means that it must be large" [00:08:26]: a big disk key aimed slightly off center so the nose casts a shadow, exposure 16 "for this scale" [00:08:58].
- An outdoor sun HDRI gives hard portrait shadows; swap to a studio HDRI as fill [00:11:36]; the same exposure on a bigger light looks dimmer (normalize) [00:13:47]; rims can be small and hot [00:13:47]; skydome camera 0 for a black background [00:53:38]; keep alternate rigs in groups [00:54:44].

## Reza Sarkamari, Light AOVs with Maya and Nuke (SARK, _jGC7_fRlfw, 2022)

Nuke Certified Trainer.

- **Light groups exist so client notes can be answered in comp** without a re-render [00:11:28].
- **The name contract:** light AOV Light Group string plus a custom `RGBA_<group>` AOV; a typo renders an empty pass with no error [00:05:41] [00:06:15] [00:07:19]. Code: `group_contract`, `near_duplicates`, `check_sums` empty layers.
- Audit the rig in the Light Manager and solo each light first [00:01:28] [00:02:33]; tests at 540, finals at 1080; final AA 8, diffuse 2, specular 2, diffuse depth 2 for his toy product [00:07:52] [00:08:27]; merged EXR, half precision [00:08:59]; plus merges in Nuke, rebuild equals beauty checked by toggling [00:10:57] [00:13:33].

## Maya Learning Channel, Color Management: ACES default (MLC, FODVxXOIrvM, 2022)

- ACES tone map: rendering value "a bit more than 16" maps to display 1 and 1.0 to about 0.81 [00:02:13]; the legacy sRGB gamma view clipped everything above 1 [00:02:46]. Old light values must be re-judged, not copied. `display_approx` reproduces 0.84 for 1.0 and 1.0 for 16 (offline test), a screening curve only.
- Policies and the `OCIO` variable override scene settings; a policy rewrites old scenes on open [00:03:21] [00:03:52] [00:04:22].

## Arnold and Maya 2027 documentation (SMP, AOV, LGT, CM)

- **Sampling model (SMP):** rays per pixel = AA^2 x samples^2 (AA 6 with specular 6 = 1296; AA 3 diffuse 2 = 36) (§ Camera (AA), § Sampling); typical final AA 4 to 8, rarely 16; IPR defaults AA 3, diffuse 2, specular 2, transmission 2, SSS 2 (§ Using AOVs to Identify Noise).
- **Noise map:** alpha to AA; indirect diffuse to diffuse; direct diffuse and direct specular to light samples; indirect specular to specular; transmission, SSS, volume to their samplers; diffuse seen through reflections only improves with AA (§ Clean Renders table, § Diffuse Surfaces Through Reflections). Setting a light's Samples to 0 disables it (LGT § Samples, Note).
- **Global Light Sampling:** one count, 4 or fewer on CPU, 1 or 0 when a skydome or distant light dominates; environment and distant lights are not managed by it (§ Global Light Sampling, § Limitations); MtoA 5.6.0 adds per-light sampling mode (local) and raises the GLS max to 1024 (version deltas 2.6).
- **Adaptive:** only engages with AA >= 2 and Max AA > AA; for localized noise (DOF, blurred speculars, buzzing rims, hair); off in low-AA previews; Max AA 20 and threshold 0.015 in the text, 0.05 in one caption (§ Adaptive Sampling) [verify the 2027 default].
- **Fireflies playbook** (§ Fireflies - Boat Scene, § Volumes - UFO scene, § Light Decay Filter): roughness, ray switch, visibility on the emitter, mesh light off its mesh, light decay filter, per-shader clamp, global clamp last. More specular samples did not help the sun-on-sea case.
- **Emission is the noisiest light:** emissive surface at diffuse 16 in 5:36 still noisier than a mesh light at diffuse 2 in 9 s (LGT § Mesh Light vs Emission).
- **Interiors lit by a skydome:** portals over every opening, Interior Only (LGT § Light Portal); final diffuse depth 4 (SMP § Denoising a Room Interior).
- **Lights (LGT):** power = color x intensity x 2^exposure; normalize on keeps energy constant with size; unsupported: Maya ambient, volume light, constant decay; blockers on any light, barndoor and gobo spot-only; instanced lights need light linking none; the skydome is not in the light linking window.
- **AOVs (AOV):** three additive sets rebuild RGBA; at most 16 light AOVs; ungrouped lights land in `<aov>_default`; in LPEs use `<L.'group'>`; per-light-group indirect AOVs exclude emission since Arnold 7.3 (version deltas 2.6); 8-bit outputs get the view transform, 16/32-bit the output transform, Raw by default (§ Arnold Driver Advanced Output > Color Management).
- **Denoisers (AOV):** OIDN imager by default in new scenes, Apple GPUs M1+, first in the chain, box filter, full frames; noice for finals and sequences with variance AOVs, N, Z, denoise albedo, Preserve Layer Name, not multipart; filter strength 0.45 (0.2 keeps texture, 0.8 for GI and SSS); `-ef` up to 2; no `-t` on macOS; OptiX and Arnold GPU absent on macOS.
- **Color (CM):** ACEScg default; the shipped rules tag .tx, .hdr and .exr Raw; rules live in user prefs; Apply Output Transform to Renderer only for previews, off for EXR; precedence scene < `OCIO` < policy.
- **Render Setup (CM):** collections top-down; `*foo*` misses namespaces; scripted time, distance, angle overrides in internal units; shader overrides fail on stand-ins; Render Setup nodes dropped on import or reference, so templates; exclusive with legacy layers per session.
- **Batch (LGT, PY, WN25):** command-line renders watermark without an Arnold license; since Arnold 7.3 batch renders abort on a license failure by default (`abort_on_license_fail` true, batch only), and WN25 names `ARNOLD_FORCE_ABORT_ON_LICENSE_FAIL` as the override (the 0 = watermark reading used by `mx_run` is [verify]); kick: `kick -licensecheck` before a long batch, `-set options.abort_on_license_fail true` to fail loudly (LGT § Useful Commands); Render > Render Sequence avoids the watermark interactively; kick loads every dylib in its working folder; save before rendering from a script.
- **Cameras (LGT § Cameras, § Aperture):** `aiApertureSize` is the RADIUS of the aperture in world units, `aiFocusDistance` the distance in perfect focus, blades 0 = circle; the doc's "smaller aperture, shallower depth of field" is a slip (smaller is deeper). Depth-of-field arithmetic is not in the sources: `dof_plan` and `dof_zone` use the thin-lens geometry with a circle of confusion of frame width / 1200 [added].
- **Skydome resolution (LGT § Resolution):** default 1000; match the HDRI for accurate reflections, often lower is fine, higher costs importance-table precompute. With Arvid's 1k for lighting (ARV-T 00:07:54) the decider is whether something mirror-like sees the dome.

## Outdated in the sources (do not copy into 2027 code)

- Guerilla Render numbers (2048 samples, 0.03 threshold, 16 bounces) do not port to Arnold [BR 01:04:37].
- Per-light samples as the main knob and Low Light Threshold tuning predate GLS [ARV-T 00:06:39; SMP].
- "Output Denoising AOVs", AOV shaders and OptiX per-AOV filters sit in Legacy; noice "variance" is now Filter Strength.
- Maya IPR does not work with MtoA 5+: Arnold RenderView (version deltas 2.6).
- Viewing through sRGB gamma, gammaCorrect nodes, HDRIs on Raw under ACEScg, the downloaded ACES 1.2 config, ACES2065-1 as a rendering space, hardcoded color-space strings (version deltas 2.7, 3).
- `maya -render` and `Render -pre/-post` are obsolete; `Render -log` is Windows only.
- Simple bloom and `bloom_radius` are deprecated in 5.6.0 (aperture mode).
- Constraining lights for shadow-map resolution belongs to the shadow-map era [BR-B ch8 Constrain of lights].
