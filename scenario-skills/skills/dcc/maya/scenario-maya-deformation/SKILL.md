# Maya deformation (character TD)

Expert deformation is decided before the first weight: joint pivots and edge loops set what skinning can do. Weights are then built region by region, judged in motion at extremes with numbers and renders, and every fault is fixed where it originates. Stance: block rigid, diagnose, smooth and shape, correct what weights cannot, and keep everything regenerable as data. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-maya-expert (execution channel, review loop, 2027 version traps).

Module [`scripts/mx_skin.py`](scripts/mx_skin.py): weights IO, region blocking, masks, mirror, transfer, ROM generator, deformation metrics, correctives, Skin Tools wrappers. **Status (2026-09-24):** its pure-Python half ran offline (`test_mx_skin_offline.py`, all pass); every Maya call is **not yet run in Maya** (tests: `tests/code/maya-deformation/run_all.sh`, via `mx_run.py`).
`import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<skills>/scenario-maya-deformation/scripts"); import mx_skin as S`

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Raw blocked weights are a rig test.** Assign every vertex 100% to its closest joint and pose: it "should look relatively close to your expected final result"; if not, fix pivots, placement or loops first. Smoothing a rig fault away: "don't do this in production" (Makauskas). Loops running along the wrist or ankle are the modeler's fault; volume loss at a clean elbow is the rig's (antCGi).
- **Fill the region, art-direct in the mask.** One layer per decision: twist joints get an even fill, the shape of shrug, shoulder and elbow lives in the mask, so re-smoothing twists never breaks the elbow (Jao). "Mask is not an actual influence", it is the layer's alpha (Makauskas). Headless, `S.block_regions` composites the same stack and writes once.
- **Judge in motion, one motion per test.** Calisthenics: keys every 10 frames, a pose on every second key, back to bind between, never bend and lower together (Makauskas); extreme and "weird" poses expose errors. ML pose data: one joint at a time in about 30 degree steps (Widup).
- **Smoothing is not free.** Sparse fingers lose volume: smooth the middle loops, then Sharpen (Makauskas). Measured here [added]: smoothing a 110 degree elbow cut stretch from 3.9x to 1.5x but collapsed the inner elbow (edge ratio 0.19). Deep bends need correctives, not more smoothing.
- **Skin Tools layers are an authoring state.** While layers exist, Maya blocks the classic paint, mirror, copy, hammer, set-max-influences and normalize tools; Delete Skin Layers keeps the evaluated weights and is the handoff step (Help). "It's still a normal Maya skin in the end" (Jao).
- **Choose the corrective's space before sculpting.** Pre-deformation is "like fixing the original character's mesh" and holds in other poses; post-deformation fixes one posed result, in Transform Space when one joint owns the fix (faster, bounded by that joint's envelope) or Tangent Space when it follows the surface across joints (Help; the cross-joint reading is [added]). Extremes first, then in-betweens (Help). Engines: secondary joints driven by swing-twist pose fractions, each assigned to its LODs (Rudy).
- **Read the joint the rig actually moves.** Bind joints driven by IK/FK constraints or an offsetParentMatrix blend are posed through their controls. Pose Editor: create the interpolator without neutral poses, add the controller's driving attributes in Driver Settings, then Add Neutral Poses; Euler Twist when a wrist twists about the forearm (Help). Node readers use `dagLocalMatrix`, since an OPM drive leaves rotate at 0 [added].
- **Face: budget first, joints for rotation.** Ask for the joint and shape budget first; a neutral with lips slightly parted made skinning "night and day easier" (Burton). Eyes, lids and jaw stay on joints even in shape faces, and split shapes must sum exactly to their master (antCGi). The ML Deformer learns what you feed it: skin joints in the Control Collector, Delta Mush removed first, pose coverage over network size (Widup).

| Target runtime                          | influence cap, DQ allowed, correctives as shapes or secondary joints, face shapes or joints | film-style in Maya: no cap while authoring, prune 0.01 at the end [added]; game: the engine's or lead's cap (Numbers) |
| Skeleton (scenario-maya-rigging)        | regions, twist chains, mirror rules, how bind joints are driven (constraint or OPM)         | bind joints only, rotations zero, L_/R_ names, twist joints in every limb section (3 to 5 in the sources)             |
| Mesh (scenario-maya-retopology-uv)      | bind method, shells                                                                         | Heat Map on a watertight single shell with joints inside; Geodesic Voxel for multi-piece or non-manifold              |
| Deformation brief                       | stylized squash (two clusters), clothing, face scope, hero vs background (ML Deformer)      | body plus clothing as separate skinned meshes; face = jaw, eyes and lids on joints                                    |
| Skin Tools API (`S.skin_tools_probe()`) | layered or plain path                                                                       | plain cluster with in-memory layers; real layers only when a person will paint them                                   |

## Workflow

1. **Intake gates.** `mx_validate.validate(profile="model")`, `mx_audit.verdict(r, symmetric=True)`, `S.bind_precheck(mesh, joints, method)`. GATE: no error lines, joints inside, transform frozen, no non-deformer history, X symmetry; face: lips apart, eye joint at the eyeball center (Burton).
2. **Bind, explicitly.** `S.bind(mesh, joints, method, skin_method=0, normalize=1)`: pass every flag, since cmds and UI defaults differ and the Help contradicts itself on `normalizeWeights`. GATE: `S.weights_verdict(S.audit_weights(...))` clean; `S.export_weights_json` backup (OpenMaya writes are not undoable).
3. **Block and diagnose.** `S.block_regions` with closest-bone regions, no smoothing; key calisthenics (`S.rom_schedule`, `S.key_rom`); `S.deformation_test`; `S.pose_snapshots` then `mx_review.review` headless and look. GATE: raw poses read close to the goal; faults go back to scenario-maya-rigging (pivots) or scenario-maya-retopology-uv (loops) with numbers and images.
4. **Regions, twists, masks.** Order: torso, clavicle and shoulder, upper arm, forearm, hand, thumb, fingers, head and neck, legs, feet (Makauskas). Twist chains as even ramps, masks as ranges along bones; with the API, `S.st_add_region_layer` and `S.st_flood`. Tune mask ranges, not vertices. GATE: audit clean, warnings shrink pose by pose, worst poses looked at.
5. **Mirror and shells.** `S.mirror_skin` (or the Skin Tools Mirror tab); clothing and accessories take the body under them (`S.copy_nearest`, `S.remap_by_closest`, volume smoothing limited to the shell). GATE: mirror error < 0.01, nothing unmatched, no penetration at rest.
6. **Full ROM.** Sections at mid-forearm and mid-upper-arm, bone volumes, folds, cross talk, rigid soles, clothing penetration; then combined "weird" poses and animator-style play; a GUI playblast when a session exists. GATE: no `error:`, every `warn:` fixed or explained, [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md) at 2 or more.
7. **Correctives.** Candy wrapper: twist distribution, then DQ or weight-blended skinning. Deep bends: pick pre or post and the target space (stance), check `S.joint_drive(joint)` and pose through the controls when it is driven, then `S.solve_pre_corrective` from a posed sculpt plus `S.corrective_driver`, or the Pose Editor in the GUI (controller-driven order above; extremes first; Regularization from 0.01). GATE: 0 at rest, 1 at the pose reached through the controls, residual < 1e-3 cm; ROM rerun.
8. **Face, if in scope.** Shapes through the split generator (`S.split_targets`, `S.add_split_targets`), or a joint face with a zero rest pose (Burton); squash under tweaks as two clusters (`multi=True`, UV Pin reading cluster 1, group inverse into bindPreMatrix). GATE: split error < 1e-5, counts within budget, double-transform test passes.
9. **Finalize.** `S.delete_skin_layers`, `S.prune_and_limit` to the target cap, ROM rerun, weights JSON (plus layers JSON), `mx_validate.validate(profile="rig")`, a new saved version.

## Quality gates

Measurable (headless, `mx_run`): `S.weights_verdict` clean at the target cap; `S.deformation_test` without `error:` (cross talk is impossible under pure skinning); warnings fixed or explained; mirror error < 0.01; `penetration` increase 0 for clothing; correctives 0 at rest and 1 at the pose through the controls; split error < 1e-5; `S.skin_layers_node(sc) == []` before handoff; re-imported JSON reproduces the weights (diff < 1e-4).
Visual: `S.pose_snapshots` of every ROM pose rendered with `mx_review.review` (clay and wire, front and three-quarter, same cameras every iteration), or a GUI playblast. Look at shrug and deltoid, elbow crease, wrist twist, fingers, groin and knee while lifting the foot, feet, neck, clothing; faces: mouth corners, cheek squash, lids. Judge with `references/critique.md`.

## Handoffs

- **Receives from scenario-maya-rigging:** bind skeleton (joints only, rotations zero, oriented, single root, L_/R_ names or labels), controls for the ROM, twist joints placed, and whether bind joints blend by constraint or offsetParentMatrix; `mx_validate(profile="rig")` clean. From scenario-maya-retopology-uv: mesh frozen at the origin, no history, symmetric, loops across every joint, UVs, face with lips apart and eyes in place.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-animation:** a new rig version with layers deleted, weights and layers JSON, the ROM verdict JSON, the sheet or playblast looked at, what was not verified; referenced, never imported.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-pipeline-scripting (game skins):** weights capped and pruned for the engine, bind skeleton only as influences, secondary joint list with LOD assignments, correctives as joints when the engine needs them; audit JSON for its FBX export check.
- **Sends back:** pivot and placement faults to scenario-maya-rigging, loop faults to scenario-maya-retopology-uv, each with the pose, numbers and image.

## Maya 2027 notes

- Skin Tools (ngSkinTools-based) is built in: Skin > Skin Tools; layers only after explicit initialization; Bind Skin's Initialize Skin Layers is off by default; the paint preference defaults to the classic tool.
- Scripting: `from ngSkinTools2 import api` (Developer Help, fetched 2026-09-24; not yet imported): `init_layers`, `Layers`, `assign_from_closest_joint`, `flood_weights` (acts on the component selection), `PaintModeSettings`, `NamedPaintTarget.MASK`, `export_json`, `import_json`.
- Skin > Smooth Skin Weights uses the Skin Tools algorithm and errors on multi-layer clusters; Rigid Bind menus are gone (bind with one influence); `performSkinCluster.mel` is removed.
- Several skinClusters per mesh need `skinCluster(multi=True)`; tool lists show the newest cluster first.
- `mlDeformer` command (2026), `dgaTension` for stretch analysis (2026.3), Apply Mesh Compare (2026); Bifrost 3.0 ships with 2027; old experimental rigging modules are incompatible.
