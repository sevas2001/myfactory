# Maya expert (router and agent protocol)

Expert Maya work is a loop, not a script: block big to small, and at every stage measure, render, look and fix before adding detail. This skill is the protocol every Maya task follows, the shared toolkit the other scenario-maya-* skills call, and the map to them. Target: Maya 2027 on macOS Apple Silicon, driven through Python. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**Status (2026-09-24):** Maya 2027 is not installed yet. Every Maya call in [`scripts/`](scripts/) and `references/` is **not yet run in Maya**. The pure-Python parts and the Maya-layer logic ran offline against fakes and pass. First action once Maya is installed: `tests/code/maya-expert/run_all.sh`, then read `archive/tests/maya-expert/<stamp>/results/test_00_probe.json` and correct anything marked [verify] here.

## 1. Execution channels

| Channel                                                              | Use for                                                                                         | Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headless `mayapy` through [`scripts/mx_run.py`](scripts/mx_run.py)   | audits, validation, exports, Arnold review renders, batch work, anything that needs no viewport | `python3 mx_run.py [--scene f.ma] [--plugins mtoa,fbx,abc,usd] job.py -- args`. One child process per scene: a crash or hang costs one job. The last stdout line is `MX_RESULT {json}`; exit 0 ok, 1 job error, 4 timeout. Children get `MAYA_DISABLE_ADP=1` and Maya's stderr at `warning` (`--maya-log all` to debug). Script nodes off. Never overwrite the source: `--save-as` a new version.                                                               |
| Live GUI Maya through [`scripts/mx_bridge.py`](scripts/mx_bridge.py) | playblasts, viewport captures, interactive tools, the user's open scene                         | Emmanuel starts [`mx_bridge_server.start()`](scripts/mx_bridge_server.py) once in the Script Editor. Then `Bridge().run(code)`: any length, multi-statement; every record carries `result`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `maya_messages` (Maya's warnings and errors) and the traceback, even on a timeout. Read them every call. One call = one undo chunk. Check `cmds.file(q=True, modified=True)` before replacing a scene. Never open modal UI. `stop()` when done. |

Do not launch a GUI Maya yourself [added]: it takes a license seat and cannot be driven without the bridge. One Arnold render at a time per machine [added].

mayapy: `/Applications/Autodesk/maya2027/Maya.app/Contents/bin/mayapy` (Maya 2027 Help). `mx_run.find_mayapy()` checks `$MX_MAYAPY`, `$MAYA_LOCATION/bin/mayapy` (on macOS `MAYA_LOCATION` ends in `Maya.app/Contents`), then the newest `/Applications/Autodesk/maya20*/`. Log `cmds.about(version=True)` at session start: Smart Bevel, MtoA and USD for Maya differ across 2027.x.

**Why files for the bridge:** a commandPort defaults to MEL, a 4096-character buffer (longer commands close the connection, longer results become an error) and returns the result of one statement only (Maya 2027 Help, commandPort; Python in Maya). `mx_bridge` sends one short line and exchanges code and results as files (GG_MayaMCP pre-installs a handler; Palmer uses two round trips). Security: the port is opened as `127.0.0.1:<port>` [verify with lsof] and has no authentication; Maya's help warns an INET port runs any command, including `system()`, as the user. Personal machine only, close it after the session.

## 2. The expert loop (every domain)

1. **Brief in numbers.** Purpose (engine, film, still, animation), budgets (triangles, texture size and texel density, frame range and fps), style, references, deadline. When the brief is silent, take the domain skill's documented default and write it down.
2. **Stages** from the domain skill, big to small. Never start with detail.
3. **Build one stage** with small, idempotent scripts (get-or-create by name, tag what you create, selection-free).
4. **Gate the stage** with measurable checks ([`mx_audit.verdict`](scripts/mx_audit.py), [`mx_validate`](scripts/mx_validate.py), the domain's numbers) AND a render you open with the image reader (`mx_review.review` sheet headless, or a playblast in the GUI). Experts turn the model constantly; the contact sheet is the agent's orbit. Judge it with the domain's `references/critique.md`.
5. **Fix before advancing.** A problem found at blockout costs one script; found after texturing it costs the stage.
6. **Deliver with evidence:** the saved version, audit and validation JSON, the sheet or playblast, and a list of what was not verified.

Never report a model, rig, shot or render as done without having looked at a render of it. Numbers first, then eyes: Fragapane's standard for a matching tool is the inverse of the expected matrix times the computed one equals identity, not "looks right" (Cult of Rig, [01:16:03]); dcc-mcp's showcase proves claims with deltas of 0.0 and color drift of at most 1/255.

## 4. Shared toolkit (`scripts/`, not yet run in Maya)

Import: `import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<this skill>/scripts")`. The bridge server adds this folder to Maya's `sys.path`, so `Bridge().call("mx_audit", "audit", "crate_geo")` works in the GUI too.

- `mx_run.py`: `find_mayapy()`, `run_subprocess(job, args, scene=, plugins=, timeout=, save_as=, maya_log=)` (parent side, parsed dict), `child_environment()`, `run(job, args)` (inside mayapy).
- `mx_bridge.py` / `mx_bridge_server.py`: `Bridge(port=7001).ping() / run(code) / call(module, fn, *a, reload=True) / fetch(id)`, `format_record(rec)`; server `start() / stop() / handle(id)`.
- `mx_audit.py`: `audit(mesh, texture_size=2048, units="cm")` returns counts, poles by valence, non-manifold, lamina, zero-area, borders and holes, winding, UV sets and bounds, UDIM tiles, overlapping and folded shells, texel density per shell, frozen transforms, pivot, history, naming, instances, symmetry on X, edge-length CV; `verdict(report, profile="game"|"film"|"subd")` lists `error:` / `warn:` / `info:` lines; `audit_all(roots)`. Guards for all skills: `mfn_mesh(shape)` (None on an empty mesh), `is_empty_mesh`, `split_history` (bind pose and weight drivers are not history).
- `mx_review.py`: `review(targets, out_dir, views, modes, resolution=1024, tile=512, focus=None)`: front, side, back, threequarter, top, low; clay, wire, silhouette, normals, opt-in `checker` (`checker_repeats=`) and custom `shader_modes=`; `subdiv=`; one labeled sheet plus tiles and each view's camera (`r["cameras"]`, review.json, `pixel_ray`), the user's settings restored. Skills use these options, never `_Session`. `turntable(targets, out_dir, frames=24)`; `playblast(path, start, end, display={...})` (GUI only).
- `mx_validate.py`: `validate(profile="model"|"rig"|"shot", roots=None, rules=None, fix=())`: naming, namespaces, history, frozen transforms, non-manifold, lamina, n-gons, UVs, locked normals, smoothing, render stats, layers, sets, unused and unknown nodes, plug-ins, references, script nodes, units and up axis, frame rate, missing files; `SAFE_FIXES`; roots held by UUID across fixes (`roots_after`).

## 5. Rules for Maya code (what generalist code gets wrong)

- **Selection-free and explicit:** pass node names to every command; never `select` then operate. Capture creation returns (`polyCube` returns `[transform, history]`, `#` names expand) and use them, not the name you asked for (Autodesk intro series).
- **Long names or UUIDs** for anything that can share a short name; `or []` after `ls`, `listRelatives`, `listConnections` [added, probed].
- **Undo is your job:** wrap GUI edits in an undo chunk with `try/finally`. OpenMaya 2.0 writes never reach the undo queue, and deleting with OM2 a node cmds created corrupts undo (Fragapane, [01:17:49]). OM2 for heavy reads and matrices, cmds for edits a user may undo.
- **Units:** OpenMaya works in centimeters and radians; cmds returns UI units and degrees [added, probed in `test_00_probe`].
- **Never touch nodes you did not create**; tag your own (namespace, attribute or set) and clean up by tag. Save stage versions, never over the source.
- **Main thread only:** cmds raises off the main thread (Maya 2027 Help).

## 6. Maya 2027 traps that break remembered code

- PySide6 only; ship no PySide2 fallback (it crashed 2027.0 when PySide2 was installed). `dockControl` is gone: `workspaceControl`.
- New scenes use OpenPBR Surface; its parameters do not port from Standard Surface (emission in nits, thin film in micrometers, SSS radius roles swapped).
- `addDoubleLinear`, `multiplyDoubleLinear`, `pointMatrixMult` became `addDL`, `multiplyDL`, `pointMatrixMultDL` (2026); plain names like `power` now create unitless nodes.
- Removed flags: `getAttr(noEvaluation=)`, `attributeQuery(computeModifies=)`; all keys is `cutKey(time=(None, None))`.
- Arnold on macOS: CPU only, no OptiX; OIDN imager in new scenes; Maya IPR does not work with MtoA 5+ (Arnold RenderView); batch renders abort on license failure unless `ARNOLD_FORCE_ABORT_ON_LICENSE_FAIL=0`.
- Color: OCIO v2 and ACEScg; the default input space is `sRGB Encoded Rec.709 (sRGB)` since 2026.2; query names, never hardcode them.
- Skin Tools layers block the classic weight tools (Mirror, Copy, Hammer, Paste, Normalize, Set Max Influences) until deleted.
- `maya -render` is obsolete: `Render -r <renderer>`; Render Setup and legacy render layers are exclusive per session.
- `mayaUSDExport` defaults: `frameRange` [1,1], catmullClark scheme, `map1` renamed `st`.
- `MFnMesh` raises on an empty mesh (use `mx_audit.mfn_mesh`); `MItGeometry` needs group -1 for all vertices. PyMEL is not bundled; the Python version is undocumented: probe it.
