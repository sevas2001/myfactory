# Maya retopology and UVs

Expert retopology is a loop plan with the fewest polygons that still deform: landmarks first, rings around eyes and mouth, three loops per joint, poles where nothing moves, a bend test that says whose fault a bad crease is. Expert UVs spend texels where the camera looks, at a density derived from the closest shot, with padding that survives mips. Without a mouse the agent reuses approved topology, builds from data, and measures then renders every stage. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-maya-expert (execution channel, review loop, 2027 version traps). Toolkit: [`scripts/mx_retopology_uv.py`](scripts/mx_retopology_uv.py) (`import mx_retopology_uv as RU`), built on mx_audit, mx_review and mx_run.

**Status (2026-09-24):** every Maya call is **not yet run in Maya** (not installed); 99 pure and 40 fake-Maya checks pass offline. First run `tests/code/maya-retopology-uv/run_all.sh`, then fix what `job_probe_commands` reports.

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Landmarks first, big polygons, then fill like a puzzle.** FlippedNormals: starting small is "a terrible way to work"; loose is recoverable, tight is not (9N4rG5qHWgk [00:01:05] [00:02:07]). The loop map is data before any vertex; a template fit is gated at base density before spans are added.
- **Reuse approved topology.** FlippedNormals carry one perfect hand, ear or base mesh to every model ([00:10:11]); Jessica Dru Johnson's standard base cut face skinning from three days to 30 minutes (ZiYEO49B768 [00:58:51]). Quad Draw substitute: `RU.fit_template`.
- **No automatic topology on what deforms.** On a face it "will look normal, but it's not" (FlippedNormals [00:23:15]); automatic is for parts that do not animate ([00:22:13]). Retopologize serves props, armor plates, static cloth; on a torso or loose coat it is a flagged start that must pass the deformation gate.
- **Isolate and bound deformation.** Concentric rings around eyes and mouth, one control plus two support loops per joint, a flat loop from lip corner to jaw corner against shearing (Jessica [01:15:51] [01:30:10]), equal lid loop counts (FlippedNormals [00:21:41]). Poles in still areas or skin folds ([00:12:45]); triangles only in cavities; never n-gons: ZBrush triangulates them and blend shapes break ([00:05:31]).
- **Test the bend before handoff, blame the right artist.** antCGi: loops running along a joint (wrist, ankle, hip crease) are the modeler's fix; volume lost at a correctly looped hinge is the rig's, for correctives; prove it by swapping topology under identical weights (x07USYlvu2o [00:10:27] [00:16:24]). Fit lids over the real eyeballs, with enough loops to curve over the cornea on a blink ([00:15:18]; RlNnp4qQIrU [00:08:24]). Shear (Jessica [01:13:06]) judges face hinges; on limbs a linear blend shears even perfect rings [added, measured].
- **Retopologize traps (Maya 2027 Help).** `polyRetopo` re-runs on edits and file open: delete history; Pause the node while changing several attributes. Preprocess Mesh (default on) smooths detail: noisy 100k+ triangle input only. Hard surface 1 / 1 / 0. Never half a mesh. Edge component tags steer flow.
- **Texel density from the closest camera.** Paulino: frame the reference piece at the closest shot, double its screen pixels, round to a power of two, Get/Set on every shell (iL2iXizf9xM [00:02:33]). Film: one density, UDIMs. Games: uniform, scale up the head, stack mirrored shells (MLC s_KLbTUdKms [00:10:57]).
- **Padding is a mip problem; bake prep is geometry.** 4 px between shells, 2 px to the border, doubled per mip step; Room space stays 2 px (Maya 2027 Help). Hard edges on UV seams, one triangulation for bake and export, the whole mirrored model baked with mirrored UVs one tile over (Polycount), a low that hugs the high (On Mars YDu9pYMkkSM [00:17:45]).

## Establish first

| Input               | Why it changes the plan                                                                           | Default when the brief is silent                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose             | film cage subdivided at render vs real-time triangles plus bakes                                  | real-time                                                                |
| Deformation, engine | face rig, blend shapes; one extra mouth-corner span forced a fifth influence (Jessica [00:59:24]) | face and limbs deform; 4 influences, confirm with scenario-maya-rigging  |
| Budget              | triangles from the lead (Polycount); "exactly as high as needed" (FlippedNormals [00:13:46])      | propose one from screen coverage, as an assumption                       |
| Closest shot        | texel density                                                                                     | 1920 x 1080, 85 mm on the head (Paulino)                                 |
| Textures            | map size, 0-1 or UDIM, lowest mip, strategy (optimized, technical, continuous)                    | games: 0-1 seen at a quarter size; film: 4K UDIMs; characters continuous |
| Template, eyes      | base mesh; eyeballs to fit lids on                                                                | ask scenario-maya-modeling for a primitive-blocked base and eyeballs     |
| Pose                | neutral face, relaxed A-pose, eyes forward (Jessica [01:00:30]; antCGi e74KphYwMww [00:07:39])    | report a posed source                                                    |

**Clothes fused to the body (AI meshes).** Tight garments become body topology with loops on the garment lines; loose layers get their own tube or template projected onto the fused source [added]; plates may slide but the torso stays one piece (Jessica [00:44:17]); wrinkles that never animate go to Retopologize or the bake (FlippedNormals [00:22:13]).

## Workflow

1. **Intake, read only.** `mx_audit.audit(source)`; the source stays the bake source. `RU.prep_source` makes the working copy (weld, soften, report non-manifold); a broken source is rebuilt or used only as projection target (P2). Orient by the transform (cm, Y-up, +Z front, feet at 0). GATE: numbers written; clay sheet looked at.
2. **Map.** Landmarks, ring counts per opening, joint stations, flows (mouth corner under the cheek; neck along the sternocleidomastoid, clavicle to skull back, antCGi RlNnp4qQIrU [00:09:32] [00:37:43]), a method per part. GATE: the map is JSON before any geometry.
3. **Build per part.**

   | Part                                   | Method                                               | Call                                                              |
   | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Face, head, hands, body with a base    | landmark fit                                         | `RU.fit_template`                                                 |
   | Limbs, fingers, sleeves, skirts, tails | plane sections, 1 + 2 loops per joint                | `RU.limb_stations`, `RU.build_tube`                               |
   | Props, armor plates, static cloth      | Retopologize                                         | `RU.retopologize(mesh, faces, hard_surface=...)`                  |
   | Torso or face without a base           | primitive base from scenario-maya-modeling, then fit | Retopologize only as a flagged start for Quad Draw (gui-paths.md) |

   Then cavities: mouth bag, nostrils, eye pouch (FlippedNormals [00:25:16] [00:27:22]). GATE: `mx_audit.verdict` clean per part.

4. **Relax, center, mirror.** `RU.relax_project`, `RU.snap_center`, `RU.mirror_half` (weld 0.001, antCGi QW8w15J00Ok [00:02:56]); combine symmetric parts (e74KphYwMww [00:24:32]). GATE: no center drift, symmetry 100%.
5. **Gate the topology.** `RU.retopo_report` plus wire and clay sheets in the source's views.
6. **Deformation-ready gate, before UVs** (antCGi unwraps after it). `RU.deform_test(mesh, chain, bends, review_dir=...)` per limb (elbow and knee at 90 and 130 degrees, wrist, ankle, hip; twist judged mid-limb, never at shoulder or wrist, x07USYlvu2o [00:08:40]), `kind="hinge"` for jaw open, `RU.lid_check(head, eyeball)`. Proxy weights, no skinCluster: binds are scenario-maya-deformation's. GATE: no `topology` verdict, lids ok, pose sheets looked at; `rig` verdicts travel as notes; prove a fix with `RU.compare_variants` (P19, P20).
7. **UVs.** Seams as edge loops (`RU.loop_keys`, `RU.cut_seams`): neck base, head slits, inside the mouth, sleeve line, back of the arm, wrists, waist, inner legs, boot tops, soles (MLC [00:01:37] to [00:08:05]); cloth on its real seams (Paulino [00:05:16]). `RU.unfold`, `RU.optimize`; limb shells `RU.orient_shell` then `RU.straighten_rows` (MLC [00:04:49]); `RU.mirror_uvs(mode="mirror")`. GATE: planned shells, no folds, distortion in band.
8. **Density and packing.** `RU.density_from_camera` (film) or `RU.density_for_budget` (games); `RU.set_texel_density` (head bias in games); `RU.layout(scale_mode="off")` with `RU.mip_padding`; UDIMs, or `RU.mirror_uvs(mode="stack", offset_u=1.0)` for game bakes, never where AO or a logo differs; `RU.lightmap_set`. GATE: `RU.uv_report` ok; UV and `RU.checker_review` sheets looked at.
9. **Bake prep.** `RU.harden_uv_borders`, `RU.bake_check`, `RU.make_cage` or `RU.project_to_surface`, `RU.bake_copy`, `RU.overlap_review(low, high, out)` (P21). GATE: high inside the cage, hard edges only on seams, one triangulation, silhouettes match.

AI character end to end: procedure P18.

## Quality gates

In code (MAYA, not yet run in Maya):

```python
rep = RU.retopo_report("body_geo", "scan_high", openings={"eye_L": {"point": (3.2, 163, 8.5)}},
                       joints={"elbow_L": {"center": (45, 140, -2), "axis": (1, 0, 0), "radius": 6}})
dt = RU.deform_test("body_geo", [shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand_tip],
                    [{"name": "elbow_130", "joint": 1, "angle": 130, "axis": (0, 1, 0)}])
lid = RU.lid_check("body_geo", "eyeL_geo")
uv = RU.uv_report("body_geo", 4096, smallest_mip=1024, target_density=20.48, images_dir="/abs/out/uv")
print(rep["fails"], dt["verdict"], lid["fails"], uv["fails"])     # full arguments: procedures.md
```

Topology: 0 n-gons, no `polyRetopo` history, 3+ clean rings and equal halves per opening, 3 loops per joint band, triangles only in cavities, eyes denser than the cranium, no center drift, no `topology` verdict. UVs: all faces mapped, no unintended overlap, padding at the lowest mip, density on target, hard edges only on seams (games).
Visual: wire and clay sheets (rings close, even squares); pose sheets (creases where anatomy creases, no pinching); UV sheets; checker in three views plus the closest shot; overlap diff images (red: high outside the low). Score with [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md).

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from scenario-maya-modeling (base meshes, eyeballs, `mx_validate(profile="model")` clean), scenario-zbrush-expert (real scale, neutral; posed sources go back), scenario-3d (FBX or OBJ [verify glTF]; its remesh only for static parts); loop faults back from scenario-maya-deformation with pose and numbers.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-rigging and scenario-maya-deformation:** a new version, `<part>_geo` frozen without history, cm, Y-up, centered, feet on the grid, eyes separate and forward, mouth bag, symmetric parts combined; `retopo_report`, `deform_test` (rig notes: hinges needing correctives) and `lid_check` JSON, wire and pose sheets.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-lookdev:** UV sets, px/cm, UDIM table, the bake package (high, triangulated bake copy, cage, offsets, tangent basis: MikkTSpace for Unreal and Unity; Arnold `normal_map` has a MikkTSpace mode from MtoA 5.6.1.1, Maya 2027.1), `uv_report` JSON.

- Quad Draw is interactive only (Make Live first); its 2027 hotkey table is lost, so gui-paths.md's 2018 panel is [verify]. `polyRetopo` flags are unsaved: `RU.call` passes only flags `cmds.help` lists. Flow Retopology (cloud, 2027.1) needs a sign-in: not headless. Reduce is decimation.
- Broken source: Mesh > Booleans Volume mode with a Voxel size (2026) rebuilds watertight but needs a second input; Mesh > Remesh evens the spread before Retopologize.
- Unfold3D is the default, refuses non-manifold meshes, pins unselected UVs (Legacy: selected only). Relax is Optimize > Legacy. Texel Density needs Map Size first; Measure has Pixel Distance.
- `dgaTension` (2026.3) measures stretch against a reference mesh for a heat map (`RU.tension_node`, attributes [verify]). A hand-made test bind leaves Skin Tools layers uninitialized (the default), so `skinPercent` floods work; on a skinned mesh delete Non-Deformer History, never History (antCGi [00:12:41]).
