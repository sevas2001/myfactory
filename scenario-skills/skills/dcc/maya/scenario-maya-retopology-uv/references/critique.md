# Critique rubric: judge your own retopology, UVs and bake prep

How the source experts judge the work, turned into checks. Run the code first, then open the sheets and walk the visual rows in order. Score each section 0 (fails), 1 (works with visible problems), 2 (clean) and report every 0 or 1 with its cause and the fix you will make. A blocker fails the whole handoff, whatever the other scores. Thresholds marked [added] are this skill's defaults.

## 0. Setup

```python
rep = RU.retopo_report(mesh, source, openings=..., joints=..., cavities=..., regions=...)   # P9
uv  = RU.uv_report(mesh, map_size, smallest_mip, target_density, images_dir=out + "/uv",
                   profile="game" or "film", check_hard_edges=(profile == "game"))           # P15
dt  = RU.deform_test(mesh, chain, bends, review_dir=out + "/rom")  # per limb and face hinge  # P19
lid = RU.lid_check(head, eyeball)                                                            # P20
ov  = RU.overlap_review(low, high, out + "/overlap")                                         # P21
sheets: mx_review.review([mesh], ..., modes=("wire", "clay"), views=front, side, threequarter, low)
        the same views of the source in clay; a wire close-up of the face (focus);
        RU.checker_review in three views plus a close-up at the closest shot
```

## Blockers (any one fails the handoff)

- n-gons on a deforming or subdividing mesh (FlippedNormals 9N4rG5qHWgk [00:05:31]).
- `polyRetopo` left in history (Maya 2027 Help).
- Non-manifold, lamina, zero-area faces, flipped winding (`rep["verdict"]` errors).
- Center vertices drifting off 0 on a mirrored mesh (`rep["center_line"]`).
- Faces without UVs, folds or unintended overlaps (`uv["uv_audit"]`, `uv["verdict"]`).
- Padding under the lowest-mip requirement (`uv["padding"]["ok"]`).
- A face that deforms built by Retopologize without saying so in the report.
- A `topology` verdict from `deform_test` left unfixed (antCGi x07USYlvu2o [00:11:04] [00:17:37]).
- A lid vertex or edge midpoint inside the eyeball at rest or on the blink (`lid["fails"]` errors, antCGi [00:15:18]).

## Report format

Scores per section, blockers found, the numbers behind each (from `rep`, `dt`, `lid`, `uv`, `ov`), the sheets opened, what the agent did not plan (face loops inherited from the base, parts left for a human Quad Draw pass, a non-neutral source), and the fixes queued before handoff.
