## 1. FlippedNormals: retopologizing a head with Quad Draw (9N4rG5qHWgk, 2018)

Henning Sanden draws, Morten Jaeger comments; both former senior film character artists (London VFX).

Order of work

- Big to small, always: "A terrible way to work is to start too small" [00:01:05]; people have "thousands of polygons before they even connect them into loops" [00:00:34]. Same rule for drawing, sculpting and retopology [00:02:38].
- Landmarks first (nose, mouth, eyes), one area at a time, as big strips: a strip over the brow and around the socket, a strip for the mouth, a quad on the nose bridge, a ring around a nostril [00:01:36] [00:02:07]. Then main loops at low density: brow, forehead to nose, nasolabial wrapping the mouth, jaw, cheek toward the ear [00:02:38]. Then the rest is "a simple puzzle, because we already solved the main part" [00:16:31].
- Loose is recoverable, tight is not: "If something is too tight... it's incredibly difficult to go in and move the points" [00:02:07]. Do not commit to exact brow cuts early [00:03:09].
- Patches rarely have matching loop counts: add loops until they do [00:17:33] [00:18:05].
- Be lazy where nobody looks: top and back of the head [00:03:09].
- Recenter the middle line periodically: 39 center vertices had drifted to X 0.01; type 0 into world X, or the top of the head drifts [00:19:06] [00:19:37].
- Final center pass, mirror with a "pretty low" merge threshold (a high one welds what should stay apart), check smoothed (key 3) [00:23:46] [00:25:46] [00:26:20].

Topology rules

- Quads where it deforms; triangles only hidden (inside eye corners, ears, mouth, nostrils) or when one saves "five hundred more polygons"; "the absence of a triangle should not be a matter of life or death" [00:03:41] [00:05:00].
- N-gons are forbidden: ZBrush triangulates them on import, the model changes, blend shapes break [00:05:00] [00:05:31].
- Poles ("stars") are unavoidable where direction changes; place them "where deformation will be minimal, or maybe in folds of skin" [00:12:15] [00:12:45].
- Uniform, square polygons, but "always denser around the eyes than on the top of the head"; denser around nose and ears too [00:20:39] [00:21:10].
- Same loop count on upper and lower eyelids for nicer blinks [00:21:41].
- Polycount is "exactly as high as needed"; animation assets come with a spec [00:13:46] [00:14:16].
- A clean even base subdivides for resolution instead of adding loops by hand [00:17:02].
- Relax is a tool, not a strategy; clean from the start and you rarely need it [00:11:14].
- Sculpt and retopologize neutral for production [00:08:21].

Automatic topology

- Faces are always done by hand: automatic remeshers are fine for non-deforming parts (cloth wrinkles that will not animate), but on faces "it will look normal, but it's not... Don't mistake this for a completed topology" [00:09:40] [00:22:13] [00:22:44] [00:23:15].
- Reuse perfect topology: one perfect hand, ear or body transferred to every new model; production humanoids start from the company's base mesh [00:10:11] [00:10:43] [00:11:14].

Cavities and non-retopo modeling in the same tool set

- Eye socket border extruded inward into a pouch; nostrils extruded inward as recesses, because "the subsurface scattering will behave strangely if you model it as a single shape" [00:24:16] [00:25:16].
- Mouth bag: select the lip border loop, scale and shape the lips, extrude inward repeatedly; symmetry on; deleting edges or faces can break symmetry [00:26:20] [00:26:51] [00:27:22]. Even loops with Edit Edge Flow [00:27:53].
- Triangle clusters: triangulate the patch and delete every other edge to recover quads; one leftover triangle is acceptable [00:24:46].
- Why Maya over TopoGun or 3D-Coat for retopo: the general modeling tools are there [00:24:16].

On screen (Maya 2018): Make Live, Quad Draw with Auto-weld 10, Relax Auto-Lock, Extend Edge, Quad Strip Width 20, symmetry off while drawing (frame f_00045). Hotkeys in gui-paths.md.

Agent translation [added]: the order becomes data: a landmark map and ring counts before geometry; "reuse perfect topology" becomes `fit_template`; the recenter habit becomes `snap_center` in every pass; the triangle policy becomes the cavity spheres in `retopo_report`.

## 2. Jessica Dru Johnson: performance topology for animators (ZiYEO49B768, CG Futures 2018)

Senior Cinematic Artist, Blizzard in-game cinematics (StarCraft 2, WoW, Diablo 3, Overwatch). Signal between [01:10:50] and [01:34:12].

- Topology is production problem solving for the people downstream, "eat your vegetables" [01:10:50]; ask riggers and animators; her rules are her pipeline's ("a Disney style... and a Pixar style... both are completely valid") [01:11:57].
- Isolation: a loop around every part that must act independently tells the rigger where one control ends [01:13:39] [01:14:11]. Face isolation set: whole face, muzzle, mouth, nose, eyes, ears, brows; isolate heavy brows so they do not fight the eyes [01:26:20] [01:26:54].
- Consistent parallel loops; a loop "spiraling down the arm" causes artifacts and muddy weights; concentric loops let riggers say "this joint affects exactly to here and no further" [01:12:33] [01:21:55].
- Avoid shearing: quads should lengthen or shorten with the motion; shearing is a quad moving contrary to the motion, flickering between its two triangulations or collapsing; most visible on the cheek and jaw side [01:13:06] [01:13:39]. Fix: one loop perfectly flat from lip corner straight back to the jaw corner ("I just scale it in Z") [01:30:10] [01:30:42]. She finds collapses by playing the rig: bends, thumb and wrist rotations, lid closes, lip seal, jaw open [01:20:16].
- Agent translation [added]: the shear score compares each quad's corner angles at the pose with rest (topology digest P7 step 5): the largest corner-angle change, skew-dominant when it exceeds the largest log edge ratio. Measured offline: on a jaw hinge, quads along the hinge line shear 4 to 6 degrees on average, a grid turned 15 degrees 16 to 24, turned 45 degrees every quad; on a limb, a linear blend shears the inner half of perfect rings anyway (a fifth to a third of the band at 90 degrees), so shear convicts face hinges, and limbs are judged by their loops (antCGi, section 3).
- Rule of threes at joints: "one edge loop for control, two edge loops for support"; a bend needs at least the one [01:15:18] [01:15:51].
- Bony forms get an inset: kneecap, elbow (one extrude around it after the arm tube), knuckles (one inset gives three loops, then three loops per knuckle), knee-like isolation per knuckle for a hero hand [01:14:44] [01:16:27] [01:17:01] [01:17:34] [01:18:06].
- Thumb: a loop all around plus an inward inset isolates it; without the palm-line isolation it "collapses and shears" [01:18:38] [01:20:49].
- Wrist: no fancy topology, one extra loop into the arm tube [01:21:23].
- Shoulder: her animators prefer a plain tube over deltoid isolation and shape anatomy with rig controls; the secret is the back: isolate the scapula, the loop runs to the elbow and stops [01:24:07] [01:24:41].
- Mouth: concentric circles, a double circle at the lip edge, lengthwise loops meeting at one center point so lips seal, modeled flat [01:28:31] [01:29:03]. Eyes like mouths: loops line up so the lid closes fully [01:30:42] [01:31:15].
- Engine limits are topology constraints: 4 bone influences per vertex; one extra mouth-corner span needed 5 [00:44:17] [00:59:24].
- Standardized base topology: face skinning from three days to 30 minutes plus finesse [00:58:51]; animators start on temp meshes and transfer [01:08:13].
- Deliver a neutral face (flat lids, flat mouth) even if it "looks super peaceful" [01:00:30].
- Map exotic anatomy onto known joints (wings are arms and hands) [01:22:26].
- Silhouette separates a cinematic from a game character; armor plates can slide, keep the torso together for bone budgets [00:44:17] [00:45:27].
- Scope by performance: a background character may get textures and no modeling [01:33:28].

## 3. antCGi (Antony Ward): base mesh, deformation tests, model evaluation

Game-industry veteran, author of Game Character Development with Maya (book verified; the studio list, Infogrames/Atari and EA, is per the manifest and not independently verified). Sources: -mWWeFv07SI, QW8w15J00Ok, RlNnp4qQIrU, x07USYlvu2o (#ModelingInMaya), e74KphYwMww (#RiggingInMaya).

- Low to high, always reversible: low-division primitives (cylinders 12 x 8 torso, 8 x 6 limbs), loops only when shape needs them (-mWWeFv07SI [00:05:28] [00:18:44]).
- A pole on the chest or any deforming surface kinks: bevel the loop open and reroute (QW8w15J00Ok [00:09:58] [00:10:29]).
- Mirror with a custom threshold of 0.001, Border merge, minus direction; automatic thresholds eat center topology; after every mirror, hunt stray center vertices (QW8w15J00Ok [00:02:24] [00:02:56] [00:03:29]).
- Red symmetry components mean one-sided edits; undo can silently break symmetry (QW8w15J00Ok [00:06:09]).
- A Relax error is a topology error: Cleanup (non-manifold), then look for split vertices (QW8w15J00Ok [00:13:13]).
- Match loop counts before joining parts; add loops on the sparser part (-mWWeFv07SI [00:27:43]).
- Mouth-corner loop runs higher and back under the cheek and around the side of the head: blend shapes need it (RlNnp4qQIrU [00:09:32] [00:23:15]). Upper and lower lids and lips carry the same loop count ([00:05:22] [00:12:00]). Lids are modeled over eyeballs placed in the scene, never in the abstract: they "need to sit over the top of the eyeballs" (RlNnp4qQIrU [00:08:24]); blink loops come later ([00:19:46]): rotating the lid joint moves a sparse lid down "a little flat" and it pops through the cornea; more lid loops give a curve over the eye (x07USYlvu2o [00:15:18] [00:15:50]). Agent translation [added]: `lid_check` measures lid-to-eyeball clearance at vertices and edge midpoints at rest and on a full blink about the eyeball center (chords are what cut the cornea; offline, 2 or 3 loops fail while every vertex stays outside, 4 and more pass).
- Neck: build the sternocleidomastoid (clavicle to the back of the skull) into the flow; route middle-neck edges into the center line and the clavicle (RlNnp4qQIrU [00:37:43] [00:39:08]).
- Loops run across the wrist and around the ankle, not from the front of the ankle down to the heel (x07USYlvu2o [00:11:04] [00:17:37]).
- Separate topology faults from rigger faults: loops along the limb are topology; volume loss at a clean hinge is correctives; prove it by swapping topology under identical weights (x07USYlvu2o [00:10:27] [00:16:24]). He says both at the elbow: "topology is okay" on the test arm, then an updated elbow deforms better with the same weights on the full rig; the deciding test is the swap. Knees, elbows and buttocks need correctives and extra joints in the walk-to-run tests, not modeling changes ([00:20:21]); the hip crease wants an edge moved across a quad and a pole removed ([00:17:03]).
- The deformation test (x07USYlvu2o): test before texturing, even when deformation was kept in mind ([00:00:00]); a throwaway chain with a root joint at the center so the body does not follow the shoulder ([00:03:34]); bind with Neighbors weight distribution ([00:04:12]); paint in a deformed pose ([00:05:16]); floods by vertex selection, then Smooth ([00:05:49] [00:06:57]); twist is not judged at the shoulder or wrist, roll joints mid-limb take it ([00:08:40] [00:11:04]); topology can be edited on the skinned mesh, then Delete by Type > Non-Deformer History, never History ([00:11:37] [00:12:41]); unbind with Delete history, not Bake history ([00:13:49]); face tests with joints, because blend shapes break when topology changes ([00:19:00]); look for "surface artifacts, pinching or unnatural creases" ([00:18:08]); studios use a ROM file of poses from simple to extreme ([00:21:10]); then UVs ([00:22:18]).
- Agent translation [added]: `deform_test` replaces the painted bind with proxy weights computed from positions (identical for any topology, which makes the swap test exact), poses a copy, measures area ratio, flips, shear and the joint loop against an ideal ring, and classifies each bend; `compare_variants` is the swap test. The skinned ROM stays scenario-maya-deformation's. In Maya 2027 a hand-made test bind should not initialize Skin Tools layers (the DefTest note; maya-version-deltas § 2.3 lists the classic tools they block).
- Model evaluation before rigging (e74KphYwMww): units cm, scale to spec, feet on the floor, centered on X, frozen, pivots, eyes looking dead ahead (rotate back, mirror values, freeze), topology review with wireframe on shaded (mouth open with a mouth bag, loops around lids and lips, edges on muscle lines, no scattered triangles in deforming areas, knuckle loops), relaxed A-pose with arms raised and palms down, symmetric parts combined for mirrored weights [00:02:52] to [00:25:47]. Relax moves UVs: restore with Transfer Attributes from a backup, UV Sets All, Sample space World [00:19:21] to [00:20:38]. Game optimization never justifies sacrificing deformation [00:22:50].

## 4. Paul H. Paulino: finding the texel density (iL2iXizf9xM, 2020)

Texture artist (Weta, ILM, Scanline, Method; later Principal Texture Artist at Epic Games).

- The most important input is how close the camera gets; it "must be as accurate as possible to avoid redoing some of your work" [00:01:30].
- Two failures: blurred textures (too little) and far more UDIMs than needed (pipeline cost) [00:00:00] [00:00:33]. "It's always better to have more than the opposite but... avoid going overboard" [00:03:04].
- Method: resolution gate and gate mask, 1920 x 1080 ("call it 2k"), about 85 mm so the lens does not distort close up [00:02:02]; frame the reference piece as close as the camera gets; the mouthpiece covers about a quarter of the frame, about 500 px, rounded to 512; double it: at least 1K for that piece in its UV tile [00:02:33] [00:03:04]. "It doesn't have to be 100% perfect, this is just an estimate."
- Size the reference shell with Measure (one shell at a time: Measure is unreliable with several) [00:03:38] [00:04:11]; check with a labeled checker; Texel Density Get on the reference, Set on everything [00:04:44].
- Shells that do not fit a tile get cut across UDIMs [00:04:44]. Mentor Justin Holt's trick: halve an odd cloth shell and paint its tile at 8K while the rest stays 4K; density stays consistent and the seams follow the real garment [00:05:16] [00:05:48].
- Studio styles differ: fewer UDIMs at 8K or more at 4K or 2K; he prefers more UDIMs, "a personal preference" [00:05:48] [00:06:20].
- Resolution test: project a high-res texture and bake at the planned distance (Mari); blurred means more density [00:06:33] [00:07:06].
- Agent translation: `density_from_camera` (projection math plus the 2x and power-of-two rule), `udim_estimate`, `udim_table` with per-tile resolution, `checker_review` close-up as the Maya substitute for the Mari test.

## 5. Maya Learning Channel: UV mapping a game character (s_KLbTUdKms, 2017)

Autodesk official; presenter not named.

- Cut seams in the 3D view, not the UV Editor: "it can be very difficult to see what's going on" in 2D [00:01:06]. Shift-drag constrains a cut to one loop; Ctrl-drag sews a wrong cut [00:02:37].
- A bad unfold means not enough seams: "it doesn't have enough seams to lie flat yet" [00:02:07].
- Head: neck-base loop, slits along the bottom and top, inside the mouth; Orient to Edges along V [00:01:37] [00:02:37] [00:03:10].
- Arms with Symmetry Object X: the loop where the arm meets the shirt, the wrist, a seam along the back of the arm through the elbow [00:03:36].
- Straighten UVs on a whole shell rotated ~15° gives "this mess" (it straightens everything within 30° on a loop); instead align the top border to its highest UV, same for the bottom, pin both, Optimize Tool on the interior [00:04:13] [00:04:49] [00:05:19]. "Unwrapping meshes is often a balancing act between keeping regular shapes and avoiding too much distortion" [00:05:53].
- Unpin, Symmetrize the other arm by picking an edge on the line of symmetry [00:06:17]. Hands: halve and planar-project each half in Y [00:06:17]. Torso seams at the waist and under the armpits; legs along the rear and inner leg, boot top, soles [00:07:29] [00:08:05].
- Checker: "as long as the checker map pattern is roughly even around the body, then we're in the clear" [00:09:51].
- Layout, then Texel Density Get from the manually sized torso and Set on all; scale the head up "since it'll be the focal point"; Layout again with Shell Padding [00:10:22] [00:10:57].
- Stack mirrored shells (arm, hand, boot) after density is set; UV Snapshot for painting [00:11:32].

## 6. Maya 2027 Help: retopology and UVs (saved docs)

Retopology (Quad Draw, Retopologize, Make Live):

- Make Live a reference first; several live objects are allowed; without one Quad Draw snaps to the grid. Symmetric Quad Draw only on a 100% symmetric mesh (lamina faces otherwise). Auto-weld has no effect while Soft Selection is on. Fix the live mesh's normals rather than relying on Snap to Backfaces.
- Retopologize: all quads; organic defaults; hard surface Regularity 1, Uniformity 1, Anisotropy 0; Preprocess Mesh (on by default) smooths and loses detail, meant for 100k+ triangle noisy input, "not intended for use with low resolution meshes with clean geometry"; Keep Original renames the input `<name>_original`; Target Face Count is a target, detail wins; Tolerance under 10% is slow; Pause the node while editing several attributes; "Ignoring this step will likely result in polyRetopo executing again" (delete history); "You can not perform retopologize on half a mesh"; feature preservation by hard edges (too many make it very slow), edges by angle (ignores explicit hard edges within the tolerance) or edge component tags (comma lists, `<name>*` wildcards; with Keep Original, tag edits update the result live).
- Preparing: Separate, soften all but full feature loops, Cleanup (more than 4 sides, concave, holed, non-planar, lamina, non-manifold, zero-length edges, zero-area faces, invalid components), split faces with non-consecutive duplicate vertices, Merge with a tiny threshold, Remesh to even the spread, delete history. Scans: internal faces make non-manifold vertices and the Cleanup/Merge loop; watertight required; Fill Hole on non-manifold geometry makes it worse; scanners mark all edges hard.
  UVs (UV mapping tips, UV Toolkit, Unfold3D, Layout, Texel Density):
- Three strategies. Heavily optimized (real-time): density varies a lot, stretch "on purpose where it's needed", mirrorable shells stacked, shells straight along U or V, odd shapes cut, border shells straightened to pack; mobile may collapse a shell to a line (gradient) or point (flat color). Technical (pre-rendered): "all your shells have the same Texel Density", eradicate stretch, multi-tile; procedural textures may make UVs unnecessary, check with the art director. Continuous (organic characters, trees): fewer seams, preserved density.
- Optimizations: start uniform, then scale by visibility and distance (FPS iron sights highest); stacked shells receive the same AO; keep a logo unstacked (even add geometry to cut it out); cut the mesh in half before layout to ease symmetry mapping; largest and oddest shells first; 2:1 or 4:1 maps are fine; memory cost = channels, pixels and above all map count; atlases for environments.
- Shell spacing: 2 px to the border and 4 px between shells on the final texture; "every LOD/Mipmap step requires double the shell spacing": 2048 used down to 512 needs 16 px between shells and 8 px to the border.
- Unfold3D is the default; unselected UVs pinned automatically (Legacy pins selected only); refuses non-manifold; receives a triangulated mesh (non-planar faces can create hidden non-manifold cases: triangulate and run Cleanup in select mode to find them). Room space default 2 px: "avoid increasing this value past its default" (slow, distorting). Very high Iterations can give undesirable results. Organic shapes suit unfolding; walls and bottles are better planar or cylindrical.
- Layout: Packing Resolution 256, Iterations 1, Rotation Steps 90, Shell Pre-Rotation and Pre-Scale options, Padding in pixels or UVs, Shell Distribution Distribute (Tiles U, V) or Shell Centers, Scale Mode Uniform (default), Non-Uniform, Off. Fur needs non-overlapping UVs.
- Texel Density: Map Size first ("used to calculate the texel density base value"), Get, Set. Measure: U, V, Pixel Distance (several map sizes), Angle Between.
- Symmetrize cannot create UVs; it needs an edge on the line of symmetry. Lightmaps: duplicate the set, uniform density, Unstack, cut and unstack again if overlaps remain. Transfer UVs from a smoothed duplicate (Average Vertices) to map wrinkled meshes.

## 7. On Mars 3D: high to low poly (YDu9pYMkkSM, 2021, Maya 2020)

Aunmar Mohammed, games artist (self-reported credits, unverified).

- Protect the silhouette first; every kept edge shapes the outline, supports a bake on curvature, or serves the UVs [00:01:16] [00:06:54] [00:23:06].
- Budget from screen coverage before optimizing: hero grenade seen large, target about 25k tris (20k great, push at 30k); secondary at 10 to 15% of the screen much less; background 5k to 10k; "polygons" in captions is roughly half the triangle count [00:03:47] [00:04:21] [00:04:55] [00:21:31].
- Derive the low from the SubD cage: duplicate, strip holding loops and bevels, keep silhouette edges [00:05:18] [00:05:50].
- Triangles are "completely fine" to terminate loops [00:10:29].
- Round high corners need a radius of real edges on the low; two to three edges were too few [00:12:50] [00:25:29].
- Subdivision shrinks the surface; Deform > Shrink Wrap the low onto the high and the bake needs no custom cage [00:14:31] [00:17:45] [00:18:16].
- Checks: flat-black silhouettes (Use All Lights with no lights) and contrasting materials on overlapping high and low [00:01:16] [00:07:27]. Agent translation [added]: `overlap_review` renders both silhouettes from the same cameras and writes a diff image (red where the high pokes out of the low), with the differing-pixel share per view.

## 8. Polycount wiki: topology, poly count, normal maps, UVs

Community reference (Eric Chadwick, Joe Wilson and others).

- "Poly count" means triangles; vertex count matters more: UV seams, hard edges and material changes duplicate vertices; a hard edge on a UV seam costs nothing extra.
- For most meshes, "the best results usually come from adding hard edges where ever there are UV seams"; mechanical bends over about 45° get hard edges.
- Triangulate before baking and export that triangulation; mirror the triangulation too.
- Mirroring: lay out one half, mirror and weld, move the mirrored UVs exactly 1 unit (or any whole number), "use the complete mirrored model to bake the normal map, not just the unique half"; center mirror seams show, offset mirroring hides them.
- The closer the low's shape to the high, the better the bake; keep the low contiguous; floaters for normal maps, a separate non-shadow-casting object for AO.
- UV readability: islands upright, recognizable, panels on pixel rows; straight shell borders help LODs; pad enough for downsampling; UDIM is film and TV, not games.
- Poles make dimples when subdivided: flat areas away from deformation. Density where curvature is.

## 9. Supporting modeling sources

- Mario Elementza (_bpsEd_5IW4, hard surface): adjacent quads never double in size ("minimal is fine as long as it's not double") [00:08:31]; minimum density = the narrowest feature [00:17:19]; cylinders in multiples of 4 sides aligned to cuts [01:12:04]; cap revolution shapes with quads [01:14:16]. Use when judging Retopologize output on props.
- Pixar OpenSubdiv tips: regular faces, few extraordinary vertices, triangles and pentagons "used sparingly", avoid high valence (GPU hard limit about 27). Use for film cages that subdivide at render.

| Uniform or varied density (retopo) | FlippedNormals uniform but denser at eyes, nose, ears; Retopologize Face Uniformity 0 adaptive to 1 uniform                                                                                       | deformation and shape complexity per region                                       |
| Deltoid isolation or tube shoulder | Jessica's animators prefer the tube and rig controls; other pipelines isolate anatomy                                                                                                             | what the rig does: shape by controls, keep the tube                               |
| Uniform or varied texel density    | film and technical: one density (Paulino, Maya Help); games: uniform, then bias the focal shell (MLC)                                                                                             | pre-rendered vs real-time and the texture memory budget                           |
| Stacking mirrored shells           | games stack (MLC, Maya Help); film does not (every surface unique) [added inference]                                                                                                              | unique bakes, AO differences, logos                                               |
| Seam count                         | game character: many seams by body part so shells straighten and pack (MLC); continuous organic: as few as possible (Maya Help)                                                                   | painted in 3D (few seams fine) or packed tightly (straight shells)                |
| Fewer 8K UDIMs or more 4K/2K       | studio preference; Paulino prefers more tiles, avoids 8K for speed                                                                                                                                | studio pipeline; artist speed                                                     |
| Topology rework or correctives     | antCGi: loops along the limb are topology, volume loss at a clean hinge is correctives                                                                                                            | swap topology under identical weights                                             |

## 11. What the tutorials show that is different in Maya 2027

- Maya 2018 UI and the "sRGB gamma" view transform (FlippedNormals, Paulino): 2027 uses OCIO v2 ACES defaults; the Quad Draw concepts and options are unchanged.
- "UV Texture Editor" and "Create UVs": now the UV Editor, UV Toolkit and UV menu; the UV Toolkit is standard, not "new".
- Relax is Optimize > Legacy (relax); Unfold3D is the default for Unfold, Optimize and Layout.
- Not in the videos: Retopologize (`polyRetopo`), Remesh, Flow Retopology (cloud, included from 2026 with 50 jobs per month, Mesh > Flow Retopology from 2027.1, sign-in and network).
- Texel Density needs Map Size first; Measure has Pixel Distance.
- ZRemesher (FlippedNormals' automatic example) is ZBrush, not Maya.
- Deform > Shrink Wrap (On Mars) still exists; this skill uses closest-point projection instead because the deformer's attribute names are unverified [added].
- Not in the videos, useful for a broken source: Mesh > Booleans Volume mode with a Voxel size (2026) rebuilds a watertight mesh from a voxel volume (it needs a second input); Mesh > Remesh evens the spread before Retopologize (maya-version-deltas § 2.1; Maya 2027 Help, Preparing a mesh).
- Deformation test in 2027 (antCGi's lesson predates it): once Skin Tools layers are initialized, Paint Skin Weights opens Skin Tools and classic tools such as Mirror, Copy and Normalize Skin Weights are blocked; the DefTest note advises leaving layers uninitialized on a throwaway bind so the classic tools and `skinPercent` floods keep working; Smooth Skin Weights uses the Skin Tools algorithm by default and errors on a multi-layer cluster; Rigid Bind menus are gone; `dgaTension` (2026.3) gives per-vertex stretch against a reference mesh, visualized by `dgaVisualizer` (maya-version-deltas § 2.3; What's New in Maya 2026). Arnold `normal_map` gained a MikkTSpace tangent mode in MtoA 5.6.1.1 (maya-version-deltas § 2.5), so the bake package names its tangent basis.
