# Maya Expert Skills

Agent skills that let Claude (Claude Code) or Codex drive Autodesk Maya the way the experts in the best tutorials, studio talks and official documentation do. Built on 2026-09-24 with the same method as [Blender Expert Skills](../blender/README.md): transcripts of top-rated videos, cited expert notes, then skills with tools and review rubrics, graded blind against the same model without them. Start with the lead skill, `scenario-maya-expert`.

## Status

- 11 skills written from 123 expert videos (65 h) and 49 documentation pages, each with references and a tested-offline `mx_<domain>.py` module.
- Blind-graded written scenarios (round 1): 61 % without the skills, 91 % with them; all 8 scenarios improved.
- Not yet verified inside Maya: Maya 2027 was not installed when these skills were built (Autodesk sign-in pending). The Python modules are byte-compiled and tested offline against fake Maya modules only. Treat the code paths as unverified until a first live Maya run (`tests/OPEN_ISSUES.md` in the build project).

## Requirements

Maya 2027 (maya.cmds / OpenMaya, `mayapy` for batch). The lead skill `scenario-maya-expert` explains the execution channel (batch `mayapy` or a live Maya over the bridge).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill scenario-maya-expert --skill scenario-maya-animation --skill scenario-maya-deformation --skill scenario-maya-fx --skill scenario-maya-groom --skill scenario-maya-lighting-rendering --skill scenario-maya-lookdev --skill scenario-maya-modeling --skill scenario-maya-pipeline-scripting --skill scenario-maya-retopology-uv --skill scenario-maya-rigging
```

The installer puts the skills side by side, which the specialists need: they import the lead skill's `scripts/`. In the installer picker (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills`), the family is the "Expert tools: Maya" group. Update with `npx skills update`.

## Provenance

Ported from [edemaistre/maya-expert-skills](https://github.com/edemaistre/maya-expert-skills/tree/v0.1), built on 2026-09-24, with these changes: the `scenario-` prefix on every skill name, this repository's frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`), no version line in the skill bodies, the sibling-install line in each `SKILL.md`, and paths into the build project made relative.

Paths such as `tests/code/...` or `archive/tests/...` inside the references point to the build project (tests, notes) on the author's machine; they are provenance only.
