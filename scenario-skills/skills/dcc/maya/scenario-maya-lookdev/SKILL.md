description: "Use when shading an asset in Maya with Arnold: OpenPBR or aiStandardSurface materials, hooking up Substance Painter or UDIM texture sets, color spaces (sRGB, Raw, ACEScg), a normal map that looks wrong, displacement with black holes or faceting, skin SSS, chrome and metals, glass or crystal, car paint, aiStandardHair, porting Standard Surface to OpenPBR, or a lookdev turntable with chrome and gray balls. Also when textures render washed out, too dark or plastic in Arnold."

# Look development in Maya 2027 (Arnold)

Expert look dev is a material that holds under any light a lighter throws at it: correct data in (every map in the right color space through the right plug), physically meaningful base values (measured metal colors, glass tinted by depth, scattering at real scale), then deliberate imperfection, judged on a neutral turntable with reference balls, one change per render. Nothing is done before a render has been looked at. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-maya-expert (execution channel, review loop, 2027 version traps).

**Status (2026-09-24):** [`scripts/mx_shade.py`](scripts/mx_shade.py) is **not yet run in Maya**: 122 offline checks passed; the Maya layer ran against a fake `maya.cmds` (logic only). Once Maya is installed: `tests/code/maya-lookdev/run_all.sh`, then fix the attribute tables from `probe_lookdev.json`.

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Every map is a three-part contract: color space, grayscale plug, destination.** Sarkamari's table [ZtEiVa3MPLg 00:27:44]; J Hill's two questions, "what color space is it and is it black and white" [mpk6IurOWbs 00:21:43]. Base, subsurface and emission color are color (sRGB for 8/16-bit, linear Rec.709 for EXR); everything else is Raw. outAlpha with Alpha Is Luminance off reads no data (Raycast [vPHhVrxxThU 00:19:14]). Maya 2027's rules tag .tx, .hdr and .exr as Raw, so a base color .tx or EXR arrives wrong: override it, Ignore Color Space File Rules on (Maya 2027 help).
- **Under ACEScg an HDRI is linear Rec.709, not Raw.** J Hill and Raycast set Raw, correct only in a linear-sRGB rendering space; the Arnold ACES page calls a linear HDRI read as ACEScg incorrect. Colors typed from linear-sRGB tables convert to the rendering space too [added: swatches are rendering-space numbers, Maya 2027 help].
- **Metals are data, not taste.** OpenPBR base color is F0 and specular color the F82 edge tint, both from the Arnold table; IOR does nothing on metals (Arnold OpenPBR doc; official intro [tEUiIBApw-U 00:02:51]). Generalists leave specular color white.
- **Scale is physics.** Subsurface radius and transmission depth are world lengths. Glass color lives in depth, not saturation: light tint, lower depth to deepen (Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:18:13]). Skin scatters about 1 mm at real size (J Hill, scale 0.1 in cm [mpk6IurOWbs 00:18:31]).
- **Perfect reads as CG: "just look at the reflections".** Ranged noise on roughness, subtle micro bump, car-paint waviness on the coat normal, never the base (Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:35:49, 00:43:25]); J Hill's "subtle variation" layers [mpk6IurOWbs 00:23:24]. Polished metal and glass also get smudge or fingerprint roughness, the doc's own example (OPBR § Specular Roughness; Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:25:11]), as clean as the reference.
- **Build layered shaders by killing every lobe, then adding one at a time,** one or two changes per render (Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:36:52]; J Hill [mpk6IurOWbs 00:51:43]).
- **Hero close-ups displace; props use normal maps.** The normal-mapped nose "looks flat to me and fake" (J Hill [mpk6IurOWbs 00:28:39]). Bake float EXR with zero at 0 so micro detail adds, match the zero value, pad the bounds.
- **Judge on a lookdev rig, then under the reference's light.** Camera carrying chrome ball, gray ball and a diffuse chart; asset spins, then the HDRI (Raycast [vPHhVrxxThU 00:05:11, 00:07:43]). A hero product is judged against its photo, lit like the photo first (Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:02:44, 00:36:21]); a Painter transfer under Painter's HDRI and focal length (Sarkamari [ZtEiVa3MPLg 00:13:10]).

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Target             | Arnold stills or sequence vs a game engine (shade for export, judge in the engine)                                                                               | Arnold                        |

| Hero or background | per-material shaders, displacement, breakup vs one textured shader (Raycast [vPHhVrxxThU 00:11:20])                                                              | hero if it fills the frame    |

## Workflow

All stages run headless through scenario-maya-expert's `mx_run.py --plugins mtoa`; `import mx_shade as sh`. Arnold RenderView is GUI only: iterate with batch renders you open.

1. **Intake.** `mx_validate.validate(profile="model")`, `mx_audit.audit(mesh)` for UVs (every face mapped, clean UDIM tiles), real-world size from the bounding box, closed outward meshes for SSS and transmission (Arnold docs). GATE: validate clean, UVs complete, size matches the reference.
2. **Lookdev scene.** `ld = sh.lookdev_scene(["asset_GRP"], hdri=path, frames=24)`: turntable locators, skydome at HDRI width (cap 4096), HDRI tagged linear Rec.709, camera with the reference strip hidden from secondary rays. GATE: frame 1: chrome ball shows the HDRI the right way round, gray ball neutral, close to the chart's neutral 5 patch.
3. **Material plan.** One shader per material on heroes, named `<asset>_<part>_MTL` / `_SG`, assigned by a name table so remodels keep shaders (Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:01:37]). GATE: every mesh off the default shading group.
4. **Texture hookup.** `ts = sh.parse_texture_set(folder)`; `sh.build_material(ts, "case", meshes=[...], texture_set="watch_case")`. Options: `normal_mode` aiNormalMap (default), bump2d, hybrid; `tangent_space="mikk"` on 2027.1+ for Painter bakes, A/B it on a bevel [verify]; `ao="multiply"` only to match a Painter or real-time look. Pre-bake .tx (TX Manager or `maketx`) for heavy assets and batches; file nodes stay on the source images and spaces (Raycast [vPHhVrxxThU 00:13:04]). GATE: `sh.verdict(sh.lint_scene())["pass"]`; a render under Painter's HDRI and focal length matches a Painter screenshot.
5. **Base values, one lobe at a time.** `saved = sh.isolate_lobes(shader, keep=("base",))`, render, add specular, coat and the rest; `sh.apply_preset(shader, "steel_polished")` for table materials. GATE: per-material crop at final samples; highlight size and edge tint against the photo.
6. **Surface detail.** Normal map for props; displacement for hero organics: `sh.add_displacement(sg, "disp.exr", meshes, scale=s, zero=0.0, iterations=2)` (3 to 4 for finals). GATE: polygon budget printed, no clipped black patches, A/B crop normal vs displacement.
7. **Breakup.** `sh.roughness_breakup(shader, lo, hi)`, `sh.smudge_roughness(shader)` (scan or cell noise, added on top), `sh.noise_bump(shader, height, scale)`, `sh.coat_waviness(paint)`; per-object masks (dial, indices, case parts) as `mtoa_constant_` user data, no extra textures: `sh.user_mask(shapes, "mask")` (Arvid [cpMBRIWwghg 00:23:04]). GATE: on the turntable, highlights break and travel across panels, never wobble.
8. **Special materials.** `sh.skin(...)`, glass presets plus `sh.set_transmission_depth`, `sh.car_paint(...)`, `sh.hair_shader(...)`; checks in [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md). Transmissive media that touch or overlap (crystal on a gasket, liquid in glass) get a Dielectric Priority: higher wins, glass 3, inclusions 2, liquid 1 (OPBR § Dielectric Priority). GATE: lint `dielectric_priority` clean.
9. **Turntable review and handoff.** `sh.render_frames([1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43], out)` writes PNGs and a sheet; judge with the critique; `sh.handoff_report(path)`, new saved version. GATE: lint passes, sheet reviewed, not-verified list written.

## Quality gates

- **Code:** `sh.verdict(sh.lint_scene())["pass"]` (zero errors). The lint covers the texture contract (spaces, plugs, UDIM, normal routes, missing files, .tx), physical plausibility (weights, F82, glass tint and depth, dielectric priority, thin film, opacity, anisotropy, smudges), subdivision and displacement, and hygiene. Rules: `references/critique.md`.
- **Visual:** the turntable sheet and crops, judged with `references/critique.md`: breakup visible and moving, metal edge tint, glass tint deepening with thickness, ear backlight and a non-waxy nose; fireflies that survive more samples are data (Raycast [vPHhVrxxThU 00:33:43]).

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from scenario-maya-retopology-uv: a version passing `validate(profile="model")`, UVs complete (0-1 or clean UDIMs), texel density stated, bakes named by channel with normal convention and tangent basis, displacement EXR with its zero value and scale. From Substance Painter: textures, preset name, normal format, UDIM flag, the HDRI Painter displayed. From scenario-maya-groom: descriptions to shade with aiStandardHair.
- **Delivers** to scenario-maya-lighting-rendering: `<asset>_lookdev_v###.ma` (never over the source) with named materials and shading groups; `handoff_report()` JSON (materials, textures, color spaces, .tx status, displacement, a passing verdict); the turntable sheet; sampling notes (SSS, transmission depth, anisotropy, flakes to protect from the denoiser); the not-verified list. Lighting owns render settings, AOVs, light rigs and denoising.

## Maya 2027 notes

- OpenPBR is the default shader. Porting from Standard Surface (`sh.port_standard_to_openpbr`): thin film nm to micrometers, emission weight 1 to 1000 nits, SSS radius and scale roles swapped, sheen to fuzz, dispersion needs scale above 0, metal colors re-picked from the F82 table. "Convert All Standard Surface to OpenPBR Surface" skips shaders inside networks (MTOA-2560): lint after.
- Color names: default input `sRGB Encoded Rec.709 (sRGB)` since 2026.2, linear sRGB spelled two ways, "Utility - Raw" is ACES 1.x naming: always `sh.space_name(role)`. Regenerate .tx after changing the rendering space (Brejon).
- `normal_map.tangent_space_type` mikk (MtoA 5.6.1.1, Maya 2027.1); `interior_set` replaces `sss_setname`; OpenPBR thin film energy change in 5.6.0 can shift hue on old assets; Standard Hair `scattering_mode` (5.6.0).
- Maya IPR does not work with MtoA 5+ (Arnold RenderView); command-line renders watermark without a license; "Use Autobump in SSS" is deprecated; nested dielectrics on by default change old glass-in-liquid scenes.
