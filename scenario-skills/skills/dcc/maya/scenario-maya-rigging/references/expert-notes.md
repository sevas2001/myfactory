### Joints, IK, skinning, precision (rfLEBgOEW1A, 2018)

- A joint is "just a transform" with attributes bolted on for drawing, IK and skinning; know what each one computes instead of following rules passed on like "superstition" [00:05:38] [00:17:29] [01:57:02].
- Learn to work without jointOrient and treat it as bad practice; live with it when a pipeline imposes it [00:16:24]. jointOrient is a pre-multiplied rotation; zeroing it has no speed or stability benefit [00:19:08]. "Fix orient" scripts only copy rotation into jointOrient and zero rotate [00:18:35].
- IK handle creation with default tooling pushes values into jointOrient and preferred angle; zero them or script it [00:22:37] to [00:24:55].
- Preferred angle is an IK-only sign bias. With an up vector a 2-bone chain is fully determined (two lengths and the root-to-effector distance), so it is not needed; it is for 3+ bones or no up vector [00:28:25] [00:36:25] [00:39:18]. Always give 2-bone IK an up vector ("which you probably should almost always have") [00:39:18].
- Rotate order does not matter on skinned joints (skinning uses matrices, not Euler values); it matters on controls [00:41:24].
- Maya shares one solver node per type between all handles; exporting handles with a character and loading several characters "can make a mess" [00:34:43] [00:52:33]. The 2027 doc's fix: extra solvers with `createNode`, one per character (`own_solver` in mx_rig).
- 3-bone legs: several valid solutions; his pattern solves once biased to the hip, once to the ankle, and blends [00:50:53]. Custom deterministic solvers are "pretty simple geometry" [01:03:18].
- Nobody gives animators raw joints and handles; controls drive the handle and the FK, the blend attribute feeds the handle [00:58:47]. Keying through the raw handle and FK joints gives double-keyed chains [00:56:01].
- Arm layout: root at the humerus, a joint just before the elbow, the radius just off it, the wrist; "always decouple" wrist and hand, the palm is a very different transform [01:15:35] [01:16:07].
- skinCluster consumes influence world matrices and bind pre-matrices only: "The skin cluster does not care that you have joints" [01:22:26] [01:30:55]. The bind pose is a set of matrices you can reset; never delete and recreate joints because of it [01:35:18] to [01:39:12].
- Separate the authoring rig (joints for paint tools) from the consumption rig the animator gets, which can drive the skinCluster from controls directly [01:12:37] [01:33:40]. Film only: engines skin to bones.
- Precision: move the rig 100,000 then 1,000,000 units away and upside down; the mesh "fries". Joint orient has nothing to do with it; world-space magnitude does. Fix: per influence, multMatrix(influence.worldMatrix, group.worldInverseMatrix) into the skinCluster, mesh under the same group; it breaks the paint tools, so switch spaces for painting [01:41:55] to [01:53:38]. "If you wiggle things in place you will never see issues" [01:53:38].
- segmentScaleCompensate uses inverseScale, connected from the parent's scale on parenting; he disconnects it for plain hierarchical scale [00:30:08] [00:40:26].

### Parallel evaluation (_0mb4wIZi80, 2018)

- "Parallel loves static data": animation curves tell the Evaluation Manager what changes; give each component a handful of function curves from the start; "if you have no function curves chances are your rig is going to be paralyzed terribly" [00:19:35] [00:20:14] [01:16:10]. Do not flat-key 20,000 attributes either [01:16:44].
- Rig design in parallel is 2D packing: split components so independent work starts early (FK can start while the expensive foot roll runs); duplicating cheap math to remove a dependency wins [00:37:48] to [00:40:07].
- Serial rigs get slower on many-core, lower-clock CPUs; parallel rigs scale [00:41:13].
- One Python node collapses concurrency around it (GIL, unknowable side effects): "nothing will murder your performance like one of those" [00:54:03] [00:55:10]. The 2027 paper: Python plug-ins are Globally Serial by default; the advice stands.
- A pure MEL expression (reads its inputs, writes its outputs) costs about 43 microseconds and runs Globally Serial; one that calls `ls`, `getAttr` on other nodes or writes elsewhere becomes untrusted and stalls everything [01:06:43] to [01:10:31].
- `frozen` is a scheduling switch: never drive it from an animatable attribute (EG rebuild stutter or ignored); visibility switching invalidates too [01:17:18] to [01:19:00].
- "don't do Python, use expressions sparingly and don't loop unholy things through the graph" [01:23:31].

## 2. Antony Ward (antCGi; games veteran at Atari and EA, lead artist, animator and TA, author of Game Character Development with Maya)

### Model evaluation (e74KphYwMww, 2021)

- "Don't assume that because someone else has built the model that it's ready for animation" [00:01:42]. Check before rigging: cm [00:02:52]; height to the client spec (about 1.8 to 1.9 m here) [00:03:58]; feet exactly on the floor [00:04:34]; centered on X for symmetry and mirroring [00:05:44]; frozen [00:06:37]; pivots centered [00:07:09].
- Eyes modeled dead ahead, then frozen: eye controls in front of the face must aim straight; offsetting controls to match posed eyes breaks animation transfer [00:08:14].
- Topology first: open mouth and mouth bag for a face, loops at eyelids, lips, knuckles and knees, triangles out of deforming zones; send it back with a list; do not edit a client model without permission [00:10:30] to [00:13:48]. "You should never sacrifice how the model deforms" [00:22:50].
- Arms raised enough to paint under, palms down [00:23:24] to [00:24:32]; combine symmetric accessories so weights mirror [00:24:32] to [00:25:47].

### Skeleton against the Unreal mannequin (fGacyVzJGIU, 2021)

- A game skeleton "comes with its own set of rules": one hierarchy, a root at the world origin, engine names, a joint budget ("it pays to be frugal") [00:01:52] [00:06:48] [00:25:24].
- Follow the mannequin's names and joints when reusing its animations; otherwise "you can quite happily ignore the joint names and orientations and use your own setup" [00:01:52].
- Joints on edge loops, not between them [00:13:11]; spine joint just under the rib cage [00:11:24]; spine centered exactly [00:10:15].
- Root: world oriented at the origin, "essentially a locator so the engine knows where the character is"; cog duplicated from it at the pelvis [00:17:22] to [00:18:30]. His deviation: pelvis and thighs both under cog, so pelvis moves only the upper body [00:25:24] (the UE4 mannequin has thighs under pelvis [added]).
- Twist joints: lower arm mid; upper arm top and mid (the top one stays with the shoulder, twist happens along the bicep); thigh the same; calf mid; wrist and foot twist added in Part 04 [00:19:08] to [00:24:47]. Place them with a point constraint (keeps the orientation), not a parent constraint (blends orientations) [00:24:14]; `duplicate(parentOnly=True)` plus a computed midpoint does the same [added].
- Name clashes cause Unreal export errors [00:17:15].

### Rotational axes and rotate orders (FN05iGspldI, 2021)

- Verify orientation after placement; moving joints misaligns axes [00:01:51]. Root, cog, head, eyes and feet world oriented (feet: engine foot placement and walk cycles) [00:02:22] to [00:06:03].
- Orient Joint to World on a parented joint takes the parent's frame: unparent, orient, reparent [00:03:25].
- No rotation values before skinning and export [00:07:16] [00:10:14]; end joints reset to their parent [00:07:16].
- All digits curl on the same axis so one attribute makes a fist; fix the thumb's LRA, then `joint -e -zso` [00:08:10] to [00:10:14].
- Mirror Function Behavior for limbs (animation copies side to side); orientation mirroring makes "more work for the animators" [00:12:13]. Eyes: duplicate and negate translateX instead [00:13:20].
- "If you don't use Set Preferred Angle ... the elbow bends completely the wrong way" [00:15:18].
- Gimbal can only be reduced [00:16:46]; read rotate orders backwards [00:17:19]. Y-down table: default YXZ, elbows and knees YZX, twist ZXY, feet ZXY, head and eyes XYZ, shoulders, hips, cog unchanged [00:17:51] to [00:25:11]. "Make sure that your controls and any offset groups have the same rotation orders as the joints they control" [00:25:42].

### IK limbs (yls25bV-IZU, 2021)

- Neutral IK/FK switch must not move anything [00:06:35]; drift from the pole vector is removed with two locators 30 units behind the elbow, one under the IK elbow, nudging the pole until they coincide [00:06:35] to [00:09:19].
- Pole too close flips the arm; behind the arm it "twists to stay pointed" [00:05:36]. Show only the active mode's controls [00:01:24].
- Values into offsetParentMatrix so channels read zero [00:09:34]; wrist orient constraint from the IK control [00:09:53]; skin early to see weight issues [00:10:28].
- Quadruped leg: a spring-solver driver chain carrying an RP handle (thigh to calf) and an SC handle (calf to foot); the spring solver is "temperamental", RP is the stable fallback [00:12:28] to [00:18:08]. Load it with MEL `ikSpringSolver` [00:13:28]. Hock control translation to rotation through a multiplyDivide (-2, 2) [00:21:37] to [00:24:24].
- Leg root worldMatrix into the thigh joints' offsetParentMatrix; then zero translate, rotate and jointOrient, or the leg rotates backwards [00:17:02] to [00:18:08] [00:28:11].

### Space swapping (BFCggv0SV0s, 2021)

- Matrix nodes into offsetParentMatrix, "this more economical solution" [00:21:30]. Never blend to the target itself: the pole jumps to the wrist and the IK flips; blend to a locator under the target that stores the offset [00:05:18]. The locators are a feature: animators can move or animate them [00:06:58].
- Input Matrix holds the world state; copy the values in, because connecting then disconnecting leaves nothing [00:03:02] [00:03:36]. Two spaces: envelope; more: per-target weights from enum conditions, discrete 0/1 [00:11:35] to [00:18:10]. Set condition true 1, false 0 explicitly [00:18:10].

### Reverse foot (jXmK0Vl5iYA, 2021)

- One attribute from heel to ball to toe for walk cycles [00:05:32]; nodes, not set driven keys ("quite limiting") [00:16:14].
- Reverse joints aligned in top view or the roll is wrong [00:08:56]; heel pivot on the floor, moved back after testing [00:06:37] [00:25:13]; clean values on everything the network drives [00:09:28].
- Curves: ball = roll up to 25, then 50 - roll; toe = roll - 25; heel = roll below 0; clamp the ball when negative [00:17:58] to [00:27:29]. Bank by sign on inner and outer groups [00:27:30]. Toe flips during the IK/FK blend come from the constraint: interpolation Shortest [00:32:51].

### Final adjustments (DO6RztqbwzA, 2021)

- Scalability is "a fundamental part of rigging" [00:00:33]. Connect root scale only to groups that do not already inherit it [00:02:38]; multiply every stretch base length by root scaleY [00:04:50]; IK spine joints under a world-pivot scale group because segment scale compensate blocks propagation [00:06:31] to [00:07:36]; test 1.24 and 1.6, posed [00:05:56] [00:11:35].
- Animators "select the root control and then select its hierarchy to then set a key on the whole character": lock everything that is not a control [00:13:18]; FK elbows keep only their bend axis [00:17:55]; limb attribute holders point-constrained to the hand or foot bind joint [00:22:04].
- Selection sets, Tag as Controller (pickwalk, visibility mode), character set, limits footRoll -40..80 and footBank -60..60 [00:13:45] to [00:24:52]. "There's always something that gets missed" [00:25:29]. Physics-driven joints get no controls [00:26:18].
- His "GPU acceleration" claim for controller tags is imprecise: the 2027 parallel paper describes graph prepopulation.

### Spline IK spine (KiqpzKUJKt0, 2021)

- Own degree-3 EP curve snapped to the joints (auto curves shift joints) [00:05:40]; control joints skinned to the curve, not clusters [00:07:50]; spline IK ignores rotation of curve controls, wire twist: twist = shoulder - root, roll = root [00:10:49] to [00:16:43]; mid twist directly on ribbon joints with -1, -0.5, -0.25 [00:16:46] to [00:21:53]; quick-bind to test [00:23:20].

### Face joints (UpHKfUPyyBI, 2019)

- Lips as root-plus-tip pairs: roots inside the head, tips on the lip surface, so rotation arcs over the face [00:03:26] [00:06:59]; upper lip under head, lower under jaw [00:16:19].
- Face joints on both sides oriented the same way, unlike limbs [00:19:01]; cheeks and brows aligned to the surface with a temporary end joint [00:20:22]; mirrored surface-aligned joints re-oriented on the right with their own temporary ends [00:23:06].
- Orient Joint warns on rotated roots: freeze first [00:10:18]. Controls in front of the face, pivot on the joint [00:25:58].

### IK/FK matching (7R_0omGY-Ms, 2020)

- FK controls matched to IK joints; IK control to the FK wrist; one extra rig element for the pole: a locator under the FK elbow, and an ankle locator carrying the world-oriented IK foot orientation [00:02:46] to [00:08:41]. Helpers on the control rig, never the bind skeleton: "you want to keep the skeleton hierarchy as clean as possible to avoid problems during export" [00:05:04].

## 3. Maya Learning Channel (Autodesk)

- **Offset Parent Matrix (JOYMV-bQdlM, 2019, presenter Matt):** OPM applies a matrix before the node's own TRS: "define the local space of an object without needing to parent it, constrain it, or alter its pivot" [00:01:51] [00:02:40]. `worldMatrix` into OPM equals parent plus scale constraints with the channels free [00:05:20]. worldMatrix carries all parents: use `.matrix` for relative drives [00:09:15] [00:09:51]; pre-existing translation doubles, zero it [00:10:27]. 20 joints removed from one hand [00:12:36].
- **Quick Rig (c538zkwxgTQ, 2016):** Quick Rig suits "a game or background character that wouldn't be looked at quite so closely"; hero characters get a custom rig [00:00:05]. One-Click misplaces effectors: delete the definition, Step-By-Step, Imperfect Mesh for meshes with holes, resolution 256, fix and mirror guides, T-Stance Correction on for A-stance models [00:01:17] to [00:03:48]. Auto-skin is "three-quarters of the way" [00:04:21]; rigid head features constrained and the head weighted to 1 [00:05:14].

## 4. Miquel Campos (mGear lead developer; rigging supervisor on ONI: Thunder God's Tale)

- **ONI (rDHTdhzKpvI, 2023):** "we serialize everything and we build clean every single time" [00:06:42]; standardization means anyone can open any asset [00:22:05]; hand-made exceptions built fast and imported into the standard build [00:21:32]; vanilla components, effort on deformation (RBF, correctives, delta mush, layered face) [00:39:46]; blendshapes "as a polishing stage, not as the base" [01:05:36]; chained blendshape layers "horrible" for performance, kept for iteration [01:07:48]; spine IK on FK, both active, no switch [01:11:16]; UI hosts only under the world control, proxies on the arm via callbacks [00:37:34] [00:38:06]; ask for final-aim notes from day one [00:18:14]; proportions tested with a crude rig first [00:16:35]; build order: joints before skin import [00:58:58].
- **Data Centric Rigging, parallel notes (NfYAaK3wtQs, 2018):** profile early and keep dated profiles [00:05:26]; attribute hosts parented under the limbs they control wait for the whole chain; moved under the root space: about 50 to 60 fps, 20 to 17 ms per frame [00:08:35] to [00:12:51]; "the golden rule ... is graph connections and hierarchy" [00:18:54]; with several characters parallel and GPU Override fill the gaps, so heavy single-rig optimization may not pay [00:18:22].

## 5. AdvancedSkeleton (official overview, mTB9Yh_sWKc, 2018; tool by Oyvind Nostdahl)

- The rig regenerates from the fit skeleton: Toggle Fit, edit, Rebuild; never edit the built rig [00:07:11]. A single deforming chain separate from the motion system simplifies binding and export [00:06:40].
- "Anything IK related is done by joint labels"; extra attributes add behavior [00:08:18] [00:09:31]. Controls at zero after build, fit rotations pushed into jointOrient [00:10:06].
- Show the pole vector plane; a nearly straight knee can bend backwards [00:14:15] to [00:16:30].
- Animation Tester keys every axis of every control for weight review [00:19:50]. Face as skinCluster plus layered blendShape; for engines, Convert to BlendShapes Only gives one skinCluster and one blendShape [00:31:29] [00:39:20].

## 6. Bungie (David Hunt, rigging tech art lead; Forrest Soderlind, Maya tech tools lead): Tools-Based Rigging in Destiny (U_4u0kbf-JE, GDC 2015)

- The rig is "a user interface to a deeper set of tools" [00:05:40]. Components on bone chains, not regions: "an FKIK component isn't defined as an arm it can be used on any three joint chain" [00:58:02].
- Chain markup attributes plus joint labels; "I'm not saying don't do a naming convention I'm saying don't rely on too much" [00:11:38] [00:12:12]. Meta network nodes with public and do-not-touch groups as the code interface [00:22:38] to [00:23:45].
- Prototype by hand, then "it's really important to take the next step of writing a script to generate it automatically" [00:22:06]. Components removable and retargetable without losing animation; no FKIK on every finger [00:25:27] [00:58:02].
- Deformation rig and control rig separate; referencing forbids DAG edits, so they "explant" [00:42:36] [00:43:40]; a Problem Spotter batch-checks thousands of files [00:45:21]. Pedestal is a sibling, not the top of the control hierarchy [00:18:16].

## 7. Official documentation (Maya 2027 Help, Using Parallel Maya 2027, Unreal and Unity docs)

- **Joints (2027):** matrix `[S] * [RO] * [R] * [JO] * [IS] * [T]`; jointOrient stored as a quaternion (set 360, read 0); `-orientJoint` ignored with rotations, no child or `-o`/`-so`; never mirror with scale -1; spline IK start joints flip past 90 degrees; never parent the spline curve under the start joint (cycle); do not use SC on a 2-bone chain; stiffness needs all joints of the chain; one shared solver per type.
- **Matrices (2027):** OPM is "an implicit parent inbetween Dag parent and local transformation"; parentMatrix = dag parent world times OPM, so `world = local * OPM * dagParentWorld` (post-multiplied): a world matrix into OPM is world-correct only without a transforming parent or with inheritsTransform off; blendMatrix is "not a weighted average, but an ordered blend, where each successive matrix overrides the preceding matrices" (1, 1/2, 1/3 for equal thirds); parentMatrix (2025) normalizes target weights, stores a per-target Offset Matrix, Initialize Target Offset keeps the object at the Input Matrix when that target becomes the only influence, Snap Target Offset keeps it where it is; rotationFromMatrix assumes XYZ; keying a constrained object inserts a pairBlend; uvPin needs clean UVs, proximityPin does not.
- **HumanIK (2027):** 15 required nodes; no numbering gaps; strict T-stance ("Without a properly configured T-stance, the solvers will base all of their operations on faulty data"); Reference locator; segment scale compensate off.
- **mGear docs:** everything done on a built rig must be saved as data or a POST step; gimmick joints before skin import; turn off topological autoskin when lips come later.
- **Using Parallel Maya 2027:** make it right first (DG = Serial = Parallel); Serial is a debug mode; "remove coupling between parts of your rig"; static curves are excluded from the EG and changing them rebuilds it; controller tags with Include controllers in evaluation graph, two keys "each with slightly different values", locked static channels or the curve manager (`forceAnimatedCurves` none, controller, keyed, all; static curves plus curve manager: middle playback speed, parallel manipulation, no rebuild on keying) stop first-key invalidation; evaluator state is per session; Python plug-ins Globally Serial; `ikSystem` disables the EM with multi-chain IK; FBIK forces Serial; GPU Override thresholds 2000 (NVIDIA) and 500 (AMD) vertices (`MAYA_OPENCL_DEFORMER_MIN_VERTS`), 21 supported node types, exclusions (animated weightFunction, animated deltaMush smoothing attributes or original geometry, multi-geometry deformers with one CPU-bound geometry, animated topology, legacy Catmull-Clark smooth preview, back-face culling, unsupported streams), HUD "Enabled (0 k)" = nothing on the GPU, `deformerEvaluator -meshes` for the reason; animated `frozen` gives inconsistent frames. The 2027.2 release notes add a crash when scrubbing with GPU Override on (MAYA-141895).
- **Engines:** Unreal: the root joint is the skeletal mesh pivot; one animation per file; triangulate in Maya; FBX 2020.2. Unity: 4 influences by default, humanoid needs at least 15 bones in T-pose.

## 9. What changed for Maya 2027 (translate the old sources)

- Pre-2020 sources (Fragapane 2018, antCGi face 2019) predate offsetParentMatrix and the blend, aim and pick matrix nodes; parentMatrix (2025) postdates every video.
- 2026 renames: `addDoubleLinear` to `addDL`, `multiplyDoubleLinear` to `multiplyDL`, `pointMatrixMult` to `pointMatrixMultDL`; plain math names create unitless nodes. condition, plusMinusAverage, multiplyDivide, reverse and blendMatrix are not in the list.
- Orient Joint: Auto orient secondary axis and LRA buttons (2025); negative primary axes fixed in 2027.1.
- Manipulation "always serial" (Fragapane 2018) is superseded: idle graph preparation, controller prepopulation, Manipulation Prevalidation. GPU Override since 2024 schedules deformers individually; uvPin and follicles no longer push a character off the GPU. 2027.2 known issue: crash scrubbing with GPU Override (disable it or the invisibility evaluator).
- Follicle ribbons: uvPin and proximityPin now. Trax: Time Editor. ngSkinTools: Skin Tools in 2027. PyMEL (Bungie): not bundled. ShotGrid: Flow Production Tracking. Profiler: Windows > General Editors > Profiler. mGear 2.x and 3.7 in the videos, mGear 4 current. UE4 mannequin in the course; UE5 Manny and Quinn differ [verify against the project].
