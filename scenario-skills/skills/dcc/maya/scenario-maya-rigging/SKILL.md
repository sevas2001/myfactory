# Maya rigging

Expert rigging means every value is explained and every behavior measured: joints at real pivots with computed orientation, controls at zero with their placement in offsetParentMatrix, IK/FK and space switches that move nothing, and a rig that survives scale, distance, several characters per shot and an animator keying everything. The rig is the output of a build script and data. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-maya-expert (execution channel, review loop, 2027 version traps).

Module [`scripts/mx_rig.py`](scripts/mx_rig.py) (`sys.path.insert(0, "<skills>/scenario-maya-rigging/scripts"); import mx_rig as R`): not yet run in Maya; its pure math passed offline (`test_rig_offline.py`). With Maya installed, run `tests/code/maya-rigging/run_all.sh` and fix what `test_rig_probe` contradicts.

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Clean values, one place for each.** Rotations zero at rest, orientation in jointOrient (or nowhere: Fragapane), control placement in offsetParentMatrix (antCGi; Maya Learning Channel). OPM composes, `world = local * OPM * dagParentWorld` (2027 transform node): feed `.matrix` for a relative drive, or multiply a `worldMatrix` by the DAG parent's `worldInverseMatrix`, then zero translate, rotate and jointOrient or they apply twice (Maya Learning Channel; antCGi's leg rotating backwards).
- **Compute, never eyeball.** `-orientJoint` silently skips joints with rotations or no child (2027 cmds.joint); a secondary world axis along the bone is ill-defined (antCGi's toes). `R.joint_chain` computes jointOrient from positions; a pole on the chain plane adds zero drift (`R.pole_vector_position`) [added].
- **The animator defines done.** Zero pop switching IK/FK at neutral, only the active mode visible, everything else locked because animators "select hierarchy and key all", limits at breaking points, behavior mirroring on limbs, same orientation on eyes and face (antCGi).
- **Matrices before constraint stacks, and know the blend.** OPM, blendMatrix and pickMatrix keep channels free (Maya Learning Channel cut 20 joints from one hand). blendMatrix is an ordered stack, each target overriding the ones before (equal thirds: 1, 1/2, 1/3); parentMatrix (2025) normalizes and stores per-target offsets (2027 Help). Spaces blend offset targets, never the space itself, or the IK flips (antCGi).
- **The built rig is disposable.** Guides, build script, serialized weights and settings; fixes go back into the data (Miquel Campos, mGear: "we serialize everything and we build clean every single time"; Bungie). Metadata and joint labels, not names, identify chains (Bungie). A skinCluster reads only influence world matrices and bindPreMatrix: reset the bind pose, never rebuild joints for it (Fragapane).
- **Structure decides speed.** The Evaluation Graph leaves static curves out and rebuilds at the first differing key; without curves a rig "is going to be paralyzed terribly" (Fragapane; Using Parallel Maya 2027). Split components so cheap global work finishes early, even by duplicating cheap math (Fragapane); no Python nodes, scene-querying expressions or driven `frozen`; hosts out of the limbs (Miquel Campos); DG, Serial and Parallel agree before optimizing.
- **Test at the extremes.** Scale 1.24 and 1.6 (antCGi), a million units away and upside down (Fragapane), three referenced characters, a quick bind while building (antCGi).
- **Deformation skeleton apart from the control rig.** Engines see joints, skin and blendshapes only: one root at the origin, engine names, a joint budget (antCGi, Unreal and Unity docs, Bungie).

## Workflow

1. **Gate the model.** `mx_validate.validate(profile="model")` clean; cm; height to spec (about 180); feet at y = 0; centered on X; frozen; eyes dead ahead; loops at knuckles, elbows, knees; mouth bag for a face (antCGi). Send problems back as a list; never edit a client model unasked. GATE: no fail; wire sheet looked at.
2. **Place joints** at pivots on edge loops: spine joint under the rib cage (antCGi), wrist decoupled from the palm (Fragapane), elbows pre-bent back, knees forward; the first upper-arm and thigh twist joint stays at the top with the shoulder or hip, mid twist joints are placed by position so they keep the parent's orientation (antCGi). GATE: `R.chain_plane` does not raise on any limb; joints over wireframe looked at.
3. **Build and orient.** `R.joint_chain(spec, parent, up="plane")` for limbs, `up=(0, 0, 1), up_axis="y"` for spine and neck, `world=[...]` for root, cog, head, eyes and feet (antCGi: animators, engine foot placement), `end_aim=` for clavicles; existing skeletons: `R.orient_with_cmds` ('zup' for legs and spine). `R.mirror_chain`: behavior for limbs, orientation for eyes and face; rotate orders on controls (`R.rotate_order(twist, main)`; Fragapane); `R.set_preferred_angles(root)`. GATE: `R.rig_check(joints=bind)` clean; mirror within 1e-3 cm; all digits curl on one axis and sign, thumb fixed, so one attribute makes a fist (antCGi).
4. **Hand the bind skeleton to scenario-maya-deformation** (it binds while you build controls): joints only, one hierarchy, labels, `rig_check` JSON.
5. **Control rig.** `R.ikfk_limb(bind[:3], name, rig_parent, ctrl_parent, own_solver=char + "_ikRPsolver")`: handles of a type share one solver node, so several characters in a scene conflict (Fragapane: "can make a mess"; 2027 Help). Legs: `extra=[ball, toe], orient_end=False`, then `R.reverse_foot` with `R.foot_pivots_from_mesh`; spine P9; `R.space_switch(ctrl, [None, cog, chest], names=[...])`; `R.ikfk_match(meta, to="fk"|"ik", key=True)` uses stored offsets (antCGi instead adds a pole locator under the FK elbow and an ankle locator oriented like the IK foot). GATE: `R.neutral_switch_test` and pole drift below 1e-3; `R.space_test` as expected; FK and IK posed apart, `R.blend_sweep_test` finds no flip; roll sweep plants heel, ball, toe in turn; no shared-solver error; controls at zero.
6. **Scale and stretch.** Root scale only on groups that do not inherit it; stretch base lengths times root scaleY; IK spine joints under a world-pivot scale group, as segmentScaleCompensate blocks scale (antCGi). GATE: `R.scale_test` at 1.24 and 1.6, neutral and stretched, below 1e-3 cm.
7. **Lock down.** `R.lockdown`; FK hinges keep their bend axis; limits; controller tags; selection sets. GATE: `R.lockdown_audit` and `R.opm_audit(rig)` empty; the rig still works.
8. **Performance.** Key first (`R.rom_keys`, two different values per used attribute): a keyless rig profiles fast and lies. `R.eval_census(rig)`, `R.eval_ab(bind, meshes, frames)`; `R.prepare_eval_graph(root=rig)` tags every control (with the animator's Preferences > Settings > Animation > Include controllers in evaluation graph, first keys stop rebuilding the graph) and turns on the curve manager for the session. `R.gpu_override_census(meshes)`, then the GUI Evaluation HUD must show a non-zero k count, else `deformerEvaluator -meshes` says why. Profile DG, Serial, Parallel and GPU Override with 1 and 3 referenced characters; keep dated profiles (Miquel Campos). GATE: no census error; modes agree within 1e-5; each dense mesh on the GPU or its reason written.
9. **Review.** `R.rom_keys`, then `mx_review.playblast` (GUI) or `R.pose_review` (headless); `R.precision_test` at shot distances; [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md). GATE: frames looked at; elbows, knees, shoulders, wrists, feet read right.
10. **Deliver.** New version, `validate(profile="rig")` clean, test JSON, playblast, what was not verified.

## Quality gates

Code (`mx_rig`): `rig_check` (rest rotations, orientation, controls, poles, shared solvers, OPM doubling, evaluation census, lockdown), `neutral_switch_test`, `blend_sweep_test`, `space_test`, `scale_test`, `precision_test`, `eval_ab`, `gpu_override_census`, `game_skeleton_check`; scenario-maya-expert's `validate(profile="rig")`.

Visual: placement over wireframe front and side; ROM playblast of every control axis, front, side and three-quarter; foot roll scrubbed; scaled rig in an extreme pose. Look for knee pop, elbow flips, candy-wrapper wrists, collapsing shoulders, sliding feet.

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from scenario-maya-modeling or scenario-maya-retopology-uv: a mesh passing `validate(profile="model")`, cm, Y-up, facing +Z, feet at y = 0, centered, frozen, symmetric, pre-bent limbs, eyes forward.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-deformation:** the bind skeleton (joints only, one root, oriented, rotations zero, labels), `rig_check` JSON, and whether bind joints blend by constraint or through OPM (its pose readers depend on it); receives weights as data and correctives to reconnect.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-animation:** the rig to reference, controls at zero and tagged, `validate(profile="rig")` clean, switch list, ROM playblast, known limits.
- **Game rigs to scenario-maya-pipeline-scripting:** `game_skeleton_check` clean, bind blends by constraint unless an OPM export was proven; they export the FBX.

## Maya 2027 notes

- 2026 renames: `addDL`, `multiplyDL`, `pointMatrixMultDL`; plain math names create unitless nodes; condition, multiplyDivide, reverse, blendMatrix unchanged.
- parentMatrix (2025) has Snap and Initialize Target Offset; `axisFromMatrix` replaces the per-axis nodes.
- Orient Joint: negative primary axes fixed in 2027.1; Auto orient secondary axis since 2025.
- `ikHandle` lists only RP, SC and spline; load spring and 2-bone solvers first. FBIK forces Serial: use HumanIK.
- GPU Override: 2027.2 known issue, a crash when scrubbing with it on (disable it or the invisibility evaluator); the paper covers OpenCL on AMD and NVIDIA only, so read the HUD on Apple GPUs [verify]. Evaluator settings are per session, not saved in the scene.
