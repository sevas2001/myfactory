# The editor_info grammar

This is the authoring grammar for Scenario workflows: the `editor_info` document that `workflow_create` and `workflow_update` accept and `workflow_get` returns, plus the `inputs_definition` array that rides with it. `workflow_publish` compiles `editor_info` into the executable `flow`; you never write `flow` by hand.

`editor_info` top-level keys: `nodes` (array), `edges` (array), `inputKeys` (ordered array of node ids for workflow inputs), and optionally `nodeGroups` (a map of group id to `{title, color, locked?}`, cosmetic only). Records fetched from live workflows may carry extra UI fields on nodes (`measured`, `selected`, `dragging`, `width`, `height`); omit them when authoring.

## Edge direction is inverted: read this first

Persisted edges do not point the way graph intuition says. In `editor_info.edges`:

- `source` is the DOWNSTREAM consumer node, and `sourceHandle` is its INPUT handle.
- `target` is the UPSTREAM producer node, and `targetHandle` is its OUTPUT handle.

Handle ids follow one scheme:

| Handle side | Id format                  | Example                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Input       | `${nodeId}-source-${name}` | `model1-source-prompt` |
| Output      | `${nodeId}-target-${name}` | `text1-target-output`  |

So "text node `text1` feeds the prompt of model node `model1`" is written:

```json
{
  "id": "edge1",
  "source": "model1",
  "sourceHandle": "model1-source-prompt",
  "target": "text1",
  "targetHandle": "text1-target-output"
}
```

The name segment comes from the handle's `name` field. Output handle names are commonly `output`, but live workflows also show others (a text node feeding a prompt can carry a `prompt`-named output handle), so when cloning, copy handle ids from the source record instead of assuming `output`. `ifElse` output handles are named `if1` to `ifN` plus `else`.

## Node type vocabulary

`nodes[].type` uses a camelCase persisted vocabulary. The workflow editor's palette names (image-generator, prompt-builder, if-else, 3d-model, video-studio) are NOT valid persisted types; creation validation refuses unknown types before any network call.

| Persisted type  | Editor palette equivalent                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`          | Text                                                        |
| `asset`         | Image, Video, Audio, 3D model (kind in `data.type`)         |
| `model`         | Every generator, tool, and studio node (kind via `modelId`) |
| `llm`           | LLM generator                                               |
| `transformText` | Prompt builder (CEL)                                        |
| `splitText`     | Split text                                                  |
| `groupItems`    | Group items                                                 |
| `sliceAssets`   | Slice assets                                                |
| `ifElse`        | If/else                                                     |
| `forEach`       | For-each loop start                                         |
| `forEachEnd`    | For-each loop end                                           |
| `approval`      | Approval gate                                               |
| `aspectRatio`   | Aspect ratio preset                                         |
| `stickyNote`    | Sticky note (annotation only, never connected)              |

The webapp also persists a `modelInput` type (a generator setting exposed as its own node), but the creation validator rejects it: an export using exposed model inputs fails a `workflow_create` round-trip.

## Per-type data contracts

Common `data` fields on every node: `title` (display name), `isInput` / `isOutput` (workflow pin flags), `inputHandles` / `outputHandles` (arrays of `{id, name, label, type}`).

| Type            | Data fields                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`          | `value` (the string)                                                                                                                                          |
| `asset`         | `type` (`image` \| `video` \| `audio` \| `3d`, note `3d` not `3d-model`), `value` (asset id, or array when `isMultiple: true`), `isRequired?`                 |
| `model` / `llm` | `modelId`, `form` (scalar-only settings keyed by the model's input names, e.g. `{"guidance": 7.5}`; wired inputs like `prompt` never go here)                 |
| `transformText` | `value` (a CEL expression, see below); one input handle `<id>-source-input` (type `text`) that takes any number of edges, and one output `<id>-target-output` |
| `splitText`     | `splitDelimiter` (default `,`)                                                                                                                                |
| `groupItems`    | `value` (a CEL list expression)                                                                                                                               |
| `sliceAssets`   | `from`, `count`: STRINGS, not numbers (`"0"`, `"-3"`; negative `from` counts from the end)                                                                    |
| `aspectRatio`   | `output` (exactly one of `21:9`, `16:9`, `3:2`, `4:3`, `5:4`, `1:1`, `4:5`, `3:4`, `2:3`, `9:16`, `9:21`), `quality`                                          |
| `ifElse`        | `conditionBlocks` (see below)                                                                                                                                 |
| `forEach`       | `isConcurrentRuns?` (parallel iterations; ignored on nested loops)                                                                                            |
| `forEachEnd`    | `parentNodeId` (the paired `forEach` node id)                                                                                                                 |
| `approval`      | `message` (prompt shown when paused; default "Continue ?")                                                                                                    |

Only `image` and `video` asset nodes support `isMultiple` with an array `value`; `audio` and `3d` asset nodes hold a single asset id, always.

## Workflow inputs are pinned nodes

A workflow-level input is a node flagged `data.isInput: true`, ordered by `editor_info.inputKeys`. The published input's `name` IS the node id (`text1`, `image5`), which is why run-input keys look positional and non-contiguous. Outputs are `data.isOutput: true` pins on `model`, `llm`, or `forEachEnd` nodes; publish refuses a graph where no model or llm node is reachable from an output pin (the compiled flow would be empty). The webapp UI additionally requires at least one input pin and an output example image before it publishes; keep at least one of each for a usable app.

`inputs_definition` entries mirror the pinned nodes:

- Pinned `text` node: `{"type": "string", "name": "<nodeId>", "label", "description", "placeholder", "required": {"always": true|false}, "prompt": true|false, "default"}`. `prompt: true` only changes how the app displays the input (a text area with the prompt spark feature), never the wiring; `promptSpark` toggles the spark on its own.
- Pinned `asset` node: `{"type": "file"}` or `"file_array"` when `isMultiple`, plus `"kind"` set to the asset `data.type`.

The full input `type` set observed on live workflows: `string`, `integer` (typed as `number` in some layers), `boolean`, `file`, `file_array`, `string_array`, `model_array`, `number_array`, `inputs_array`. Array-typed inputs silently drop bare scalars at run time, so declare arrays only when the input truly takes a list.

## Model nodes: handles come from the model schema

A model node's input handles derive from its model's input schema: handle name = input name, so the model input `prompt` becomes handle id `${nodeId}-source-prompt`. Use `model_schema_get` on the chosen model id to learn the input names, types, and required flags: `parameters[].required` is a boolean, unlike the `required` object in workflow `inputs_definition`. Wire required inputs or the workflow cannot run. Scalar-only settings (guidance, seed, output count) go in `data.form`, not handles. Never hardcode model ids: discover them with `search` or `recommend` per team, then schema-check. LoRA and composition model ids (`runs_as` in the schema) were not validated inside graphs at authoring time: prefer plain model ids in `data.modelId`, and dry-run to validate when using one.

## CEL expressions (transformText)

`transformText` composes text at run time from connected inputs via a CEL expression in `data.value`. No LLM call is involved.

- Variables are named `${nodeId}_${outputHandleName}`: text node `text1` with output handle `output` is `text1_output`. A variable only resolves when the corresponding edge exists; connect first, reference second.
- String literals must be SINGLE-quoted. Double-quoted literals evaluate in CEL but corrupt the canvas editor's rendering of the expression, observed at authoring time.
- Concatenate with `+`: `'A portrait of ' + trim(text1_output) + ' in the style of ' + text2_output`.
- Custom functions: `trim(string)`, `slice(list, start, end)`. Standard CEL is available (`size`, `matches`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `contains`, `replace`, `split`, `substring`, `lowerAscii`, `upperAscii`, and the `has` / `all` / `exists` / `map` / `filter` macros). The ternary `condition ? a : b` works, which is how a prompt varies with an input (see the `ifElse` section).
- Never feed a `splitText` output (a list) into `transformText` (single text); route lists through `forEach` or `sliceAssets`.

`groupItems.data.value` is also CEL, producing a list.

## ifElse condition blocks

```json
{
  "conditionBlocks": [
    {
      "logic": "and",
      "conditions": [
        { "field": "text1_output", "operator": "contains", "value": "night" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `field` uses the same `${nodeId}_${handleName}` convention as CEL variables.
- Operators: `isEmpty`, `isNotEmpty`, `contains`, `notContains`, `equals`, `notEquals`. Numeric comparators are not part of the authoring surface.
- `value` is required for `contains` / `notContains` / `equals` / `notEquals` and must be omitted for `isEmpty` / `isNotEmpty`; `field` is required always.
- Block at index i drives output handle `if(i+1)`; the `else` handle is implicit and always last. Never author an `else` block. At run time the first matching block wins.
- Gate a node by wiring a branch handle into that node's own `conditional` input: `source` the gated node, `sourceHandle: "<id>-source-conditional"` (label "Is Active", type `conditional`), `target` the `ifElse`, `targetHandle` `<ifElseId>-target-if1` (or `-else`). The `ifElse` reads its condition field through one edge into `<ifElseId>-source-input`. On the branch not taken, only that directly gated node is `skipped`. A node reading it through an ordinary edge is not gated: it stays `pending` and the workflow job never completes, though the other branch's image is delivered. So gate the node that does the work (the builder or the model), never a text node in front of it.
- Merge branches by wiring each branch's output into the same input of one downstream node: publish compiles that into an input taking whichever branch ran (`ref: {"conditional": [...]}` in the flow). Validated live at authoring time: two gated `transformText` builders merged into one model's `prompt` gave the right prompt on each branch, and the job completed.
- For prompt text that varies with an input, a CEL ternary in one `transformText` needs no `ifElse`: `trim(text2_output) == 'Stormreach' ? text1_output + ', muted palette' : text1_output`, with both text nodes wired into the builder's one input handle (two edges with `sourceHandle: "transform1-source-input"`, each naming its text node's output as `targetHandle`). Also validated live. What never works is one shared builder that names an optional text node behind a branch: the template reads every node it names whichever branch fired, so the text lands every time.

## forEach loops

`forEach` iterates its list input over the loop body. In the editor the end node is auto-created; when authoring `editor_info` directly you must include BOTH nodes: the `forEach` and a `forEachEnd` whose `data.parentNodeId` is the `forEach` node's id. The loop body's terminal output feeds the end node, and downstream consumers read from the end node's outputs. `isConcurrentRuns: true` parallelizes iterations and is ignored on nested loops. Loop wiring has more moving parts than any other construct: clone a working example (see template cloning below) rather than hand-authoring your first one.

## Approval gates

An `approval` node has ONE input handle (type `approval`) and NO outputs. It attaches to the dedicated approval OUTPUT handle that producer nodes expose (`model`, `llm`, `transformText`, `splitText`, `groupItems`, `sliceAssets`, `ifElse`, `forEachEnd`). Downstream nodes still wire to the producer's regular output handles; the gate only pauses them. Routing data through an approval node is structurally wrong and will not compile. At run time the run reply and the job record carry `metadata.flow` with a per-node `status`; the gate shows as a pending `user-approval` entry there, and `workflow_approve` / `workflow_reject` (with `workflow_id`, `workflow_job_id`, `node_id`) resolve it; reject cancels the workflow or the containing loop iteration.

## Create, update, publish

- `workflow_create` params: `name` (required), `description`, `editor_info`, `inputs_definition`, `flow`. Author `editor_info` + `inputs_definition` only. `editor_info` is validated before any network call; unknown node types and missing `nodes` / `edges` are refused with nothing created.
- Creation is two calls under the hood (a create for `name` + `description`, then an update with the content) and is not atomic: if the second step fails you have an orphan draft, and the error carries its id. Recover with `workflow_update` on that id, or `workflow_delete`; re-running `workflow_create` duplicates.
- Create and update persist a DRAFT. Only `workflow_publish` compiles `editor_info` into `flow` and flips status to `ready`; a draft run returns "Workflow is not ready". Publish is user-consent territory: ask before publishing.
- Updating `editor_info` on an already `ready` workflow leaves it running the STALE previously compiled flow until you publish again; the response's publish hint is the only signal.
- Unpublish (reverting a ready app to draft) is a webapp action: the underlying API accepts a `status` field, but the MCP `workflow_update` tool does not expose one. Through MCP, fix a bad app by editing `editor_info` and publishing over the top.
- `workflow_update` includes `name` only when non-empty (renaming to `""` silently no-ops); `description: ""` does clear.
- Statuses are exactly `draft`, `ready`, `deleted`. "Has an app" really means `flow` is non-empty.
- `workflow_copy` (param `source_workflow_id`) copies `flow`, `inputs`, and `editorInfo` verbatim, skipping validation: a corrupted source copies corrupted, inherited model ids stay as-is, and a copied draft still needs publish.

## Import and export

A webapp export file is `{"version": "1.0", "name", "description", "editorInfo": {...}, "inputs": [...], "tagSet": [...]}`. Importing one through MCP is two calls: `workflow_create` mapping `editorInfo` to `editor_info` and `inputs` to `inputs_definition`, then `workflow_publish` on the returned id. Exports drop node groups and asset values (assets must be re-added), and an export that used exposed model-input nodes fails validation on import.

## Choosing nodes

- Deliverables are model nodes: a brief asking for N distinct outputs gets N model nodes.
- `llm` nodes are the top authoring failure mode. Default to none. Legitimate only when the user asked for LLM writing (captioning, rewriting, prompt variations), when fanning one brief into N different prompts via `forEach`, or when text must be computed at run time from an upstream asset; "refine the prompt" is not a reason. N samples of ONE prompt is one model node with its output-count parameter (name varies per model: `samples`, `nbImages`, `count`; check the schema), never an `llm` or `forEach` fan-out.
- Composing a prompt from several outputs is `transformText`, not `llm`.
- Tool-style models (upscale, remove background) define BOTH input and output handles, so pick the model before wiring. Studio-style composition models are fixed to their built-in model.

## Layout

`position: {x, y}` is metadata but keeps the canvas usable: nodes are about 340px wide, so chain left to right in x steps of about 400 and stack independent nodes in y steps of about 260, starting at `(0, 0)`.

## Minimal working example

This exact payload was validated live at authoring time with a real `modelId` substituted: create returned a draft with `_publishHint`, publish compiled the edge into `{"name": "prompt", "ref": {"node": "workflow", "name": "text1"}}` on the model's flow node and flipped status to `ready`, and a dry run returned `{"creativeUnitsCost": ..., "job": {}}`. One pinned text input feeding one pinned image model:

```json
{
  "name": "prompt-to-image",
  "description": "Minimal text to image app",
  "editor_info": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "text1",
        "type": "text",
        "position": { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
        "data": {
          "title": "Prompt",
          "value": "A red fox in the snow",
          "isInput": true,
          "outputHandles": [
            {
              "id": "text1-target-output",
              "name": "output",
              "label": "Output",
              "type": "text"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "model1",
        "type": "model",
        "position": { "x": 400, "y": 0 },
        "data": {
          "title": "Image generator",
          "modelId": "<discover via search, never hardcode>",
          "isOutput": true,
          "form": {},
          "inputHandles": [
            {
              "id": "model1-source-prompt",
              "name": "prompt",
              "label": "Prompt",
              "type": "prompt"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "edge1",
        "source": "model1",
        "sourceHandle": "model1-source-prompt",
        "target": "text1",
        "targetHandle": "text1-target-output"
      }
    ],
    "inputKeys": ["text1"]
  },
  "inputs_definition": [
    {
      "type": "string",
      "name": "text1",
      "label": "Prompt",
      "required": { "always": true },
      "prompt": true,
      "default": "A red fox in the snow"
    }
  ]
}
```

After `workflow_create` returns the id: `workflow_publish`, then `workflow_run` with `dry_run: true` and `inputs: {"text1": "..."}` to price and validate, then run for real: the reply carries a job for `jobs_wait` (re-call with `pending_job_ids`), as after `model_run`. To check what a run actually sent, read the workflow job's `metadata.flow` (in the run reply, or `job_get` with `verbose: true`): each node's `status` (`success`, `skipped`, `pending`), a transform node's `output` text, and a model node's child `jobId`, whose verbose record holds the prompt in `metadata.input.prompt`. The asset's `metadata.prompt` is not the text.

## Template cloning

Before authoring a first graph of any new shape, `workflow_get` a working workflow of a similar shape and copy its structure: node types, edge topology, handle id patterns, pin placement. Never reuse its node ids, asset ids, or model ids as constants. Prefer recently updated workflows as templates: the editor silently migrates older persisted shapes on load (renamed types, injected handles), but the API returns them raw, so an old workflow can teach you a grammar the validator no longer accepts.
