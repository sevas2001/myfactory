# Inventory and materials manifest

Both files are read and written by the Blender scripts next to this reference. Paths inside `materials.json` are relative to that JSON file.

## inventory.json

Written by `inventory.py` next to `Before.blend`. Read it instead of dumping the scene.

Family names `ceramic`, `enamel`, and `plastic` add a coat layer, `glass` adds coat plus a little transmission at IOR 1.46, and `leaf` adds subsurface. Other names get the plain PBR stack.

Validation runs before the scene is touched and lists every problem at once: a manifest that is not a JSON object, an unmapped material, a non-string family name, an undefined family, a missing or unreadable map file, a family missing a role, a range outside 0 to 1, a negative or non-numeric `normal_strength` or `bump_distance`, an override without a non-empty list of non-empty string `prefixes` and a string `family`, and a file used both as a basecolor and as a data map. Both scripts exit 1 with a one-line `inventory failed:` or `apply_materials failed:` message after the traceback on any failure, with or without Blender's `--python-exit-code 1`.

## Checks before the film

- Self-tile the basecolor of each family as a 2x2 sheet. A visible border means the generation carried tile edges: check that `tileSize` matched the resolution (128 for 1024, 256 for 2048), then regenerate that family with another seed, or crop the interior and re-tile locally before wiring it. The script does not detect borders.
- Open the output `.blend` once. The planar projection suits architecture; a curved prop, a UV seam, or wood grain running the wrong way is fixed by keeping that object's authored UVs or rotating its projection in Blender.
- The report sits next to the output with `.blend` replaced by `.materials.json` (`PATINA.blend` gives `PATINA.materials.json`; the script's printed result names it under `report`) and lists the geometry hash before and after, the material variants created, the packed image count (unique map files, so it can be below families times five), and `non_mesh_renderables`; the material count is original materials times families they map to, so 41 materials over 14 families produced 43 variants in one project.
