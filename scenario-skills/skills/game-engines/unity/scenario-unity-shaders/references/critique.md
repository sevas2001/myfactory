# Critique rubric: judge a shader, a renderer feature or a variant plan before calling it done

Score each line 0 (missing), 1 (claimed), 2 (measured), 3 (measured and looked at). A deliverable ships at 2 or more on every line that applies; any 0 on a "must" line blocks it. Write the score with its evidence (job id, number, contact sheet path) in the handoff packet.

## A. Correctness (must)

| #   | Check                            | How                                                                                                                 | Pass                                                                               |

| A4  | Depth Priming safe               | a `Shots` op `{"urp": {"depth_priming": "Forced"}}`                                                                 | the object still renders                                                           |
| A5  | lights under the project's paths | shots with an extra point light and an extra directional light, Forward and Forward+ (`rendering_mode` op)          | lit side changes in both paths; the `PathProbe` idea proves the switch happened    |
| A6  | shadows cast and received        | probe under the object vs open ground                                                                               | shadow luma below 0.75x open ground                                                |

| A8  | camera textures exist            | URP asset Depth or Opaque Texture on every asset that renders it; test with SSAO OFF                                | effect unchanged with SSAO off                                                     |
| A9  | no magenta, no blank             | `ut_review.image_checks` on every frame                                                                             | `magenta` and `blank` false                                                        |

## B. Look (must for visible work)

## Red flags that fail a review on sight

- "Looks right in the Scene view" with no capture, or a capture nobody opened.
- An optimization justified by instruction count.
- A `.shader` with `CGPROGRAM`, `UnityCG.cginc`, `_FORWARD_PLUS`, `SHADOWS_SCREEN`, `ComputeScreenPos`, or a DepthNormals pass returning `n * 0.5 + 0.5`.
- A custom light loop without the directional pre-loop.
- A renderer feature using `Execute`, `OnCameraSetup`, `cmd.Blit` (pre-Render-Graph API: does not run in 6.3).
- Variant counts quoted from the Inspector as if they were the build's.
- A Shader Graph Boolean keyword presented as the way to turn Alpha Clipping off (it cannot: `#define _ALPHATEST_ON 1` in every pass).
- "PSO warm-up added" with no cold and warm player runs, or one collection reused across graphics APIs.
- `EnableKeyword` on a `shader_feature` keyword in gameplay code (the dissolve "on hit" pattern).
