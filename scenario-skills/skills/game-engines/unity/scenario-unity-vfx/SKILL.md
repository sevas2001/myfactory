# Unity VFX (real-time VFX artist)

Expert VFX serves the game first: the player must read what happens, where the danger is and when it ends, on the target device, with the real number of copies on screen. Craft (layers, contrast, motion, textures) and budget (fill, particles, draw calls, memory) are both measured here: every effect is stepped frame by frame offscreen, looked at, and counted. Target: Unity 6000.3.21f1, URP 17.3, VFX Graph 17.3.0, macOS Apple Silicon. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unity-expert (channels, review loop, 6.3 traps, `ut_run`, `ut_review`, `ut_stat`, AgentKit).

**Status (2026-09-24, after the blind-grade refactor):** every procedure ran in Unity 6000.3.21f1 through `tests/code/unity-vfx/` (results in `archive/tests/unity-vfx/live_results.jsonl`, numbers in [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md)).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Gameplay before beauty** (Jason Keyser, ex-Riot). The primary shape equals the gameplay boundary; brightness is a budget spent by importance (idle and basic attacks subdued, game changers and ultimates bright); effects end with the gameplay state; review with N copies, not one. Tag every root with `VfxTier` and check the ladder (`ut_vfx.importance_ladder`; observed: slash 0.39 < muzzle 0.46 < impact 1.50 < shockwave 2.60 < explosion 5.99), the crowd (`crowd_readability`: 20 explosions at gameplay spacing read as 20 shapes, packed 2.2 m apart only 6) and the tail after a stop.
2. **On mobile, a texture moving over a mesh beats a particle cloud** (Nikola Damjanov, Nordeus: about 90% of shipped effects; particles are fluff, 100 per emitter max; overdraw hurts more than draw calls). Observed: the same shockwave as one ring mesh drew 1 layer everywhere, 0.037 full-screen equivalents (FSE) at peak, versus 5 to 7 layers where they cover and 0.35 FSE for 36 puffs. Measure fill per frame, not particle counts.
3. **Choose the system by platform and data flow.** Every target phone, WebGL, per-particle C#, Unity physics collisions: the Particle System, scriptable module by module. Thousands to millions of GPU particles, depth-buffer collisions, decals, six-way smoke, GPU events: VFX Graph, which needs compute and runs on Android only on a subset of high-end URP devices (e-book) and on the Web only through WebGPU, experimental in 6.3.
4. **One uber material, per-particle data from Custom Data.** Nordeus's uber shader: grayscale R colored by a LUT ramp, G emission, B alpha override, linear fade, erosion, second alpha, Blend and Cull per material. `AgentKit/VFX/Uber` is that shader as text; per-instance variation (erosion curve, random UV offset, wipe) comes from the Custom Data module through custom vertex streams (Hovl Studio: "a random number cannot be made in a shader"), so one material serves every variant and the SRP Batcher stays on. Stream order is a contract the audit checks.
5. **A VFX Graph is a black box with a public API** (VFX Graph e-book; Orson Favrel, Unity). Copy a template, expose a few properties and events, drive them with cached IDs; commands are deferred and `aliveParticleCount` reads -1 until the first readback, then refreshes every 60 frames (observed). Memory is capacity x stored attributes; bounds decide culling; sorting costs a dispatch; a point cache when particles only need positions, an SDF to conform or collide (both scriptable, P8, P12).
6. **Layers with one job each, contrast, order, motion** (Sirhaian, Gabriel Aguiar, Nordeus). Dark alpha body under additive heat, glow on top, distinct sorting orders for stacked alpha layers; no linear curves except loops, fast and slow elements mixed, a burst when a loop starts, something always moving; a variant sheet plays as a random fixed frame per particle, never as animation; sparks shrink while fire grows; every layer fades in and out.
7. **Do not paint what you can borrow or compute; import at the size the screen shows** (Simon Trümpler; Nordeus 256 typical, 512 max). Borrowed flipbooks get blending and a decelerating frame curve; simple shapes are generated; sprites get soft edges from motion blur, not Gaussian, and keep their values off the border; channel-packed data textures import linear (as sRGB a 0.5 gray reads 0.21, observed); LUTs stay uncompressed.
8. **In 6.3, Shader Graph particle shaders drop GPU instancing on mesh particles** silently (Fred Moreau, Unity): +69% main-thread time at 5,000 cubes with identical draw calls (observed). The audit flags it; the fix comes from scenario-unity-shaders.

## Establish first

Ask once: target tiers and frame budget (default 30 fps at 65% on mobile = 21.7 ms); compute available; post-processing on the lowest tier (no Bloom means faking glow with an additive layer); gameplay camera and distance; each effect's importance tier, frequency, damage radius and duration; copies on screen at worst (default 20); three effect pillars (Keyser); lit or unlit world, time of day. Defaults: URP, Shuriken, mesh-first on mobile, no post on the low tier, budgets `ut_vfx.BUDGETS["mobile"]`.

## Workflow

1. **Brief in numbers.** Tier, radius, duration, copies, budgets. GATE: every later check has a threshold (`ut_vfx.BUDGETS`, marked source or [added]).
2. **Choose the system and the backbone** (Stance 2, 3). Shuriken: `VfxShuriken.Build(parent, Layer, seed)` per layer; a mesh layer sets `Layer.mesh` (`VfxMeshes.Ring`, `Cone`, `QuadXZ`, Color32 vertex alpha). VFX Graph: `VfxGraphJobs.CopyTemplate`, then expose in the GUI ([`references/gui-paths.md`](references/gui-paths.md)) or, unsupported, `VfxGraphJobs.Author`. GATE: `VfxGraphJobs.Contract` lists every property and event gameplay uses.
3. **Textures and materials.** `VfxTextures.ImportVfxTexture` (Clamp, tier size; data textures sRGB off); URP particle materials through `VfxMaterials.Particle` (inspector logic via `BaseShaderGUI.SetMaterialKeywords`); uber materials through `VfxUber.Create(path, UberSpec)` with keywords set on the asset, never toggled at runtime. Fire, sparks, trails and magic stay unlit; smoke and dust go Simple Lit or six-way when lighting changes; URP particle shaders cast no shadows. GATE: queue 3000, expected keywords, no magenta, no Built-in shader (audit).
4. **Build the effect.** Worked examples: `VfxFireballKit.Build` (projectile, muzzle, impact with scorch and hot core, explosion) and `VfxMeshFx.Build` (mesh shockwave, particle shockwave, slash with Custom Data). Custom Data: `Layer.custom1X/custom1Y/custom2X/custom2Y` (curves or random ranges) sets the module and `VfxUber.Streams`. Spawn code calls `VfxSeed.Reseed(go)`: fixed seeds are for captures. GATE: `VfxAudit.AuditPrefabs` 0 errors; warns explained.
5. **Step and look.** `VfxSequence.CaptureEffect` (any prefab: copies with distinct seeds, `stop_t` for loops, shader time pinned to simulated time) or `CaptureFireball`; `ut_review.review_images`; OPEN the contact sheet. GATE: no blank or magenta frame; [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md) A and B pass.
6. **Measure.** `VfxBudget.Overdraw` (layers per pixel, FSE, heatmap), `Counts`, `VisualRadius` (mesh-aware), `ScreenTexel`; `ut_vfx.effect_verdict` or `sequence_verdict`, `texel_verdict`, `importance_ladder` across the set, `crowd_readability` on `VfxStress.StressOverdraw` at gameplay spacing, `motion_gaps` on evenly spaced loop frames; stress profile with `AgentKit.AgentProfile.PlayModeTimings` against a 0-copy scene. GATE: verdicts pass or warn with a written reason; frame delta within the VFX share.
7. **VFX Graph runtime check** (`VfxGraphJobs.PlayTest`): offscreen camera target, property + event, counts after the deferred frames, N instances batched, culled when turned away; `ut_vfx.graph_hygiene(vfx_yaml_facts(...), peak_alive)`. GATE: counts proportional to the exposed rate, `unbatchedInstanceCount == 0`, culling both ways, capacity near the alive count.
8. **Fix one thing, re-run 5 to 7, compare** (`ut_review.compare`, heatmaps side by side). Deliver with evidence (scenario-unity-expert report format).

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** audit `counts.error == 0`; effect or sequence verdict pass or explained warn (fill, particles, visual/gameplay radius 0.85 to 1.2, 0 particles after the window, tail under 0.5 s); ladder pass; crowd pass at gameplay spacing; texel verdict; stress delta; VFX Graph contract, counts, batching, culling, hygiene.
- **Visual:** contact sheet opened; head brightest in flight; nothing cut by geometry; layers fade; heatmap hotspots match something visible; consecutive instances differ.

## Unity 6.3 notes

- VFX Graph 17.3.0 is a core package; templates 01_Minimal_System to 06_Firework expose nothing; deprecated: one **Trigger Event** block with modes, **Set Position Shape**, **Collision Shape**, **Set Position From Source**, **Output Particle URP Lit Decal**; output sort is Auto, Off or On in YAML (0, 1, 2).
- `SetActiveVertexStreams` replaces `EnableVertexStreams`; URP particle shaders have no ShadowCaster pass and blend flipbooks without motion vectors (VFX Graph has Flipbook Motion Blend): keep motion-vector flipbooks for hero or slow elements (Nordeus); URP distortion samples the opaque texture, which holds no transparents.
- After 6.3: 6.5 deprecates and 6.6 obsoletes dynamic batching; 6.6 adds Shader Graph Preprocessor Directives and particle nodes; WebGPU leaves experimental in 6.6.
