# Unity mobile (mobile specialist)

Expert mobile work means a game that holds its frame rate after twenty minutes on a three-year-old phone, starts fast, installs from the store, and never double-charges or double-grants. The stance: budget the sustained frame, prove every setting on the data the device gets (imported format, built bundle, exported Xcode project), and treat stores, SDKs and money code as contracts with ugly event orders. Target: Unity 6000.3.21f1, URP 17.3, Input System 1.20, macOS with Xcode 26.6. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unity-expert (channels, review loop, 6.3 traps). Toolkit: [`scripts/ut_mobile.py`](scripts/ut_mobile.py) (imports `ut_env`, `ut_run`, `ut_stat`), editor jobs in [`scripts/AgentKit/Mobile/`](scripts/AgentKit/Mobile/), player code in [`scripts/Runtime/`](scripts/Runtime/).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Budget the sustained frame, not the peak.** About 65% of 1000/fps (10.8 ms at 60, 21.7 ms at 30), judged on p95 and max, on the lowest phone, short bursts, 10 to 15 minutes of cooldown; assume vsync, so a missed refresh halves the rate (Unity mobile e-book). Under heat, lower render scale first only when the GPU is the bottleneck: resolution barely helps a CPU-bound frame (6.3 Manual). Prove the policy with synthetic thermal events, not a hot phone (d5O4Uw6gPBI [00:04:21]). Editor timings are relative; draw and SetPass counts are the stable Editor evidence (observed).
2. **Check the effective format, then lock the rule.** A texture the GPU cannot sample is decompressed to RGBA32 on the CPU (6.3 Manual); an HDR map without an ASTC HDR override imported as ETC2_RGBA8 (observed). ASTC 4x4 UI and faces, 6x6 default, 8x8 big environment maps [added]; crunch does nothing on ASTC. Audio: WAV sources, mono SFX at 22,050 Hz at most, ADPCM under 200 KB, Streaming only above about 400 KB (e-book). An `AssetPostprocessor` keeps new assets compliant (Unity Enterprise Support, j4YAY36xjwE [00:19:07]).
3. **Mobile URP is not PC URP with a lower slider.** Depth Priming Disabled (unsupported on Android, iOS and TBDR), Native RenderPass on, Depth and Opaque textures off unless sampled, HDR off or 32-bit, soft shadows off, Store Actions Auto or Discard (6.3 Manual). One URP asset per Quality tier; a batch editor launched for Android still reported Quality "PC" (observed; same trap in 2J0kDtUGlrY [frame 00:10:28]).
4. **Release builds are reproducible from the environment.** Unity never stores keystore passwords: set them in the build process from env vars; Google refuses the debug keystore (6.3 Manual; LlamAcademy, GTaXWgKz0e8 [00:06:24]). Development Build off, symbols in the bundle from the first upload: Play never symbolicates crashes received before the symbols (6.3 Manual). Check the built bundle, not the settings.
5. **The Android main thread and the splash are shared budgets.** Most game ANRs happen while backgrounding: nothing heavy in `OnApplicationPause`, SDK init staggered after milestones, symbols shipped; read the signature, the previous exit reason on next launch, and exclude low-revenue devices that dominate ANRs (Unity Android team, pezwIhA0e04 [00:27:24], [00:25:12], [00:13:13], [00:41:40], [00:29:02]). The Resources index and first-scene `Awake` run under the splash (j4YAY36xjwE [00:33:59]); a loader scene reports its real interactive frame with `CallReportFullyDrawn` (6.3 Manual).
6. **Money code is idempotent.** Validate, grant, then `ConfirmPurchase`; dedupe by transaction id in flight and persisted; pending orders from `OnPurchasesFetched` go through the same path; a `FailedOrder` on confirm is retried with the kept order, never regranted; buy only fetched `Product` objects; never revoke on an empty Google fetch; show the store's localized price; hand `jwsRepresentation` to attribution SDKs (IAP 5 docs; Unity, szS2KMxZsl4 [00:07:27], [00:09:28], [00:11:38]). Grant rewarded ads in `OnAdRewarded` whatever the callback order.
7. **Touch is events and virtual devices; the HUD lives in one safe-area panel.** EnhancedTouch, never `Touchscreen.current` in Update; on-screen controls emit a virtual Gamepad; thumb controls at Constant Physical Size (Input System team, ptvjumIHxYg [00:20:29]). `movementRange` is a radius (observed). Render outside the safe area on, HUD in a `SafeAreaFitter` panel (Chema Damak, PLQ4ywB13eg [00:10:53]); UI Toolkit top = `Screen.height - safeArea.yMax` (proven by test). The Device Simulator is one finger, no performance, no `UNITY_IOS`, no native plug-ins (6.3 docs).
8. **SDKs and stores are contracts.** Consent answered before the first ad request, ad SDK init after the first milestone, nothing monetized in the first 10 to 15 minutes, offers when the player is stuck (Creauctopus, ILv7GzDgteQ [00:01:58], [00:09:00]); SKAdNetworkItems and every SDK's privacy manifest on iOS, AD_ID on API 33+ (LevelPlay docs; 6.3 Manual), the ATT text when you track [added]; Data safety answered from the SDK vendors' guides; one internal-track upload before IAP products can exist (GTaXWgKz0e8 [00:09:06]; UXl_C3ZnRLc [00:02:28]). 6000.3.21f1 defaults to IAP 4.15.1 and LevelPlay 8.10.1: pin 5.4.3 and 9.5.1 first.

## Establish first

Stores (Play needs an AAB); min-spec device list (GPU family decides ASTC vs ETC2); target fps per tier; download budget; orientation; ad network, IAP products, consent regimes (GDPR, CCPA, child-directed) and whether a backend validates receipts; signing material (keystore path and env var names, Apple team id: the human keeps them); whether a phone is connected (none here: device steps become a hand-over). Defaults: Mobile_High 60 fps and Mobile_Low 30 fps (Low ships, the director promotes), ASTC 6x6, min API 25, target API 36, iOS 15, IL2CPP ARM64, Vulkan then OpenGLES3, Minimal stripping to start.

## Workflow

1. **Baseline.** `MobileTiers.AuditRendering`, `MobileBuild.AuditPlayerSettings`, `MobileTextures.AuditTextures`, `MobileAudio.AuditAudio`, `MobileStartup.AuditStartup`, `ut_mobile.code_scan(P)`, `ut_mobile.package_check(P)`, all with `build_target="Android"`. GATE: findings listed, Editor Quality level recorded.
2. **Tiers and thermals.** `MobileTiers.ApplyTiers`; `MobileTierDirector` with PlayMode synthetic `Feed` events. GATE: `AuditRendering` 0 errors; per-tier captures opened; the thermal test lowers lodBias and (GPU-bound only) render scale, restores both.
3. **Assets.** `FixTextures`, `FixAudio`, `AuditMeshes`, then `ImportedFormats` and `ImportedAudio` per target; `import_rules.json` for `MobileImportRules`. GATE: 0 errors and warns, all ASTC, imported sizes down, new assets arrive compliant; captures before and after any Max Size drop.
4. **Input and UI.** `SafeAreaFitter`, `BuildTouchHud`, `FloatingTouchStick`. GATE: `SafeAreaTests` and `TouchInputTests` pass; `CaptureSafeArea` fitted HUD clear, naive HUD blocked.
5. **Frame budget.** `AgentProfile.PlayModeTimings` per tier, `budget_verdict(csv, fps)`; `DeviceSoakLogger` goes into the development build. GATE: sustained verdict pass; device soak listed as Assumed.
6. **Monetization.** Pin packages; logic in `PurchaseLedger`, `RewardGate`, `AdPacing`, `AdsInitGate`; adapters `Iap5Store` (validate, price, jws) and `LevelPlayAds` (privacy flags before init). GATE: `MonetizationTests` pass, adapters compile against the pinned packages, `code_scan` and `package_check` clean.
7. **Android release.** `make_keystore`, `MobileBuild.BuildAndroid` with `env=keystore_env(ks)`. GATE: Succeeded; `aab_findings` 0 errors (not debuggable, 16 KB pages, symbols, AD_ID if ads); `bundletool_sizes` under budget, else Build Report by size then Play Asset Delivery; passwords not persisted.
8. **iOS release.** Privacy manifest in `Assets/Plugins`, `BuildIos`, `xcode_facts` + `xcode_findings`. GATE: Succeeded, reasons carried, target GUIDs reported; `ios_archive_plan` commands (archive, App Store export, thinning report) shown to the human and run only with approval.
9. **Device and store hand-over.** Soak CSV judged by `soak_verdict`, native GPU profilers, Android vitals with ANR triage and `ExitInfo`, sandbox purchase and restore, LevelPlay test suite then removal, Play Console and App Store Connect steps (procedures M13).

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** every audit at 0 errors (warns justified); `ImportedFormats` all ASTC; NUnit (`SafeAreaTests`, `TouchInputTests`, `MonetizationTests`, `TierDirectorTests`) failed == 0; `budget_verdict` sustained pass; `aab_findings` and `xcode_findings` 0 errors; `bundletool_sizes` within budget; `code_scan` and `package_check` 0 errors; on device, `soak_verdict` pass over 20 minutes or more.
- **Visual:** tier and safe-area captures pass `image_checks` and were opened; before/after blur check for every Max Size drop.

## Handoffs

- **Receives:** scenes, prefabs and budgets from scenario-unity-expert; UI layouts from scenario-unity-ui (applies the safe-area panel and touch HUD); shaders from scenario-unity-shaders (variants, depth/opaque texture use); content from scenario-unity-world-building and scenario-textures (import policy).
- **Delivers:** tier assets and URP findings to scenario-unity-rendering-lighting; profiling CSVs and device capture requests to scenario-unity-performance; build jobs, keystore and env conventions to scenario-unity-pipeline-automation (CI); input bindings to scenario-unity-architecture; web size or browser work to scenario-unity-web. Packet: audits JSON, contact sheets, `aab_facts` and gates, `xcode_facts` and gates, NUnit totals, Verified and Assumed lists, the device and store checklist.

## Unity 6.3 notes

- Target API 36 for Play since 2026-08-31; min API 25 (26 in 6.5); Gradle 9.1.0 / AGP 9.0.0 in 6000.3.17f1+; GameActivity is the default entry point. The 6000.3.21f1 URP template ships Target API Automatic, APK output and a placeholder package id (observed): set all three. Engine libraries are 16 KB aligned (observed).
- `AndroidProjectFilesModifier` edits custom modules only: `AndroidProjectFiles.UnityLibraryManifest` does not compile in 6000.3.21f1 (observed). LevelPlay 9.5.1 adds AD_ID through its own post-generate hook (read in the source): clean-build after changing that setting.
- After `QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel`, `GraphicsSettings.currentRenderPipeline` still returned the previous asset that frame (observed): read `QualitySettings.renderPipeline`.
- App Store needs Xcode 26 and the iOS 26 SDK; 6.4 moves runtime libraries into `UnityRuntime.framework` (re-check post-process scripts). PVRTC removed in 6.4.
- Adaptive Performance is a core feature (`UnityEngine.AdaptivePerformance`); automatic control only with Android providers.
- `LevelPlay.SetConsent` is obsolete in 9.5.1 (`LevelPlayPrivacySettings`); `com.unity.ads` is legacy for monetization since 2026-01-31.
