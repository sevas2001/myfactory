# Unity UI (UI developer)

Expert UI work is a screen that keeps the same shape from a phone in portrait to a 4K monitor, answers mouse, touch, keyboard and gamepad alike, reads clearly, and costs almost nothing while it sits still. An agent gets there by building from code or text, then proving each screen with a capture at every device size, a layout assertion on the same frame, an audit, behavior tests and counters. Target: Unity 6000.3.21f1, uGUI 2.0 (TextMeshPro inside), UI Toolkit, Input System 1.20. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unity-expert (channels, review loop, 6.3 traps). Toolkit: [`scripts/ut_ui.py`](scripts/ut_ui.py) (imports `ut_env`, `ut_run`, `ut_review`), jobs in [`scripts/AgentKit/UI/`](scripts/AgentKit/UI/), runtime components in [`scripts/Runtime/UI/`](scripts/Runtime/UI/) (asmdef `AgentUI.Runtime`), UXML/USS/TSS templates in [`scripts/templates/uitk/`](scripts/templates/uitk/).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **uGUI is still the 6.3 runtime recommendation; the matrix decides.** UI Toolkit only: data binding, USS transitions, flexible layout, global styles, dynamic atlas, RTL and emoji, SVG. uGUI only: Animation Clips and Timeline, serialized events, Scene-view authoring (6.3 Manual). Custom shaders (UI Shader Graph) and world space are in BOTH columns in 6.3: never a reason to pick uGUI. No blocker: keep the project's system; UI-heavy or designer-led projects lean UI Toolkit; split by screen when both columns are needed (`ut_ui.choose_system`).
2. **One reference resolution, anchored edges, Match chosen by orientation.** 1920 x 1080, Scale With Screen Size, Match 0.5 when both orientations exist: with this landscape reference, Match 0 shrinks a portrait phone to 0.5625 (Match 1 inflates it 1.78x); the manual's "1.5x at Match 0" is its portrait reference shown in landscape. uGUI blends Match in log space, UI Toolkit linearly: 1.0 vs 1.17 at 1080 x 1920 (measured). Anchor each element to its corner while the Game view shows the design resolution, keep scale 1 (uGUI manual; Christina). Phones take a handheld multiplier set from a touch-target check (`CanvasDeviceScale`, 1.35).
3. **A uGUI Canvas is the rebuild and batch unit.** Split static and per-frame content into sub-canvases, remove raycasters from display-only canvases, untick Raycast Target on labels. Canvases never batch with each other: 400 world-space name plates are 400 batches (Andy Touch). Hide with `Canvas.enabled` (0 mesh regenerations vs 200 for `SetActive`, measured) plus `CanvasGroup.interactable`, or buttons stay navigable.
4. **Layout resolves preferred, else min, else 0.** A child with nothing to report collapses under Control Child Size; a Content Size Fitter goes only at the top; the pivot sets growth; no layout groups on per-frame UI. When a size surprises you, read min/preferred/flexible of parent AND children (`UIAudit.ExplainLayout`), never toggle checkboxes (Christina, HTQV4mukZ2M).
5. **One selection, one layer table, across both systems.** Hover selects, the first selection lands one frame after a screen shows, the last selection is remembered for the gamepad (Sasquatch B Studios). Point a scripted `InputSystemUIInputModule` at `InputSystem.actions` or rebinds never reach navigation (measured). Give every layer its own sort order from one table (`ut_ui.UI_LAYERS`: HUD 0, menus 10, modal 20): `Canvas.sortingOrder` and `PanelSettings.sortingOrder` rank against each other (drawing since 2021.2, Unity staff; input measured here); a tie leaves the top layer to Hierarchy order (Christina). Focus crosses systems through the EventSystem: `element.Focus()` selects the panel, `SetSelectedGameObject(uguiButton)` blurs it (measured). UI in its own additive scene holding the only EventSystem (Jason Weimann).
6. **Text: effects in the material, one font chain per system.** Shadow plus Outline turned 28 triangles into 280; TMP outline and underlay stayed at 30 (measured; Andy Touch). TMP fallbacks never reach UI Toolkit text, which resolves its own font and Panel Text Settings: with a CJK font in TMP Settings, the HUD still missed "設定" (measured). Gate every locale per system with tryAdd on; all fallback assets share one sampling size and padding (about a tenth); CJK split across assets; RTL means UI Toolkit (Imphenzia). Code-filled drop-downs refill on the locale event (`SettingsScreen.OnLocaleChanged`).
7. **UI Toolkit costs follow GPU state and time hidden.** At most 8 textures per batch (measured ceil(N/8)); a static panel split across vertex buffers draws twice: raise Vertex Budget (12k vertices: 3 batches at 0, 1 at 20000, measured); stencil masks break batches, so pre-cut a round minimap frame; animate transforms with usage hints; no class toggles on big containers; `[GeneratePropertyBag]` works only with the assembly attribute too (class alone gave a reflected bag, measured) (Nicolas Borromeo, Unity). Hide by duration: removal for long absences, display none in between (bindings keep running), opacity or off-screen for blinking (`ut_ui.uitk_hide_method`, costs in procedures P16). Find idle invalidations with `PanelChangeLog`; a stylesheet loads every asset it references.
8. **Capture the UI the way it renders, then assert on the same frame.** Overlay canvases never reach a camera target (0 UI pixels, measured): capture uGUI through Screen Space Camera on a hidden camera, UI Toolkit through a cloned PanelSettings with `targetTexture`. Look at every sheet, including a 4K crop.

## Establish first

Platforms and orientations; inputs; languages (CJK, RTL) and which system renders each string; who edits the UI later; the system already used; the device list (defaults: phone portrait 1080 x 1920 at 420 dpi, laptop 1920 x 1080, 4K); palette (default: flat neutrals, one accent); a UI scene shared across levels; the budget (default: idle HUD adds no GC, 1 batch, 0 panel changes per frame).

## Workflow

1. **Route.** `ut_ui.choose_system(needs, ui_heavy, existing, team)`. GATE: blockers quoted, shared rows not used as reasons, a layer table when both systems ship.
2. **Set up.** `UISetup.ImportTmpEssentials`, `UISetup.AddScenesToBuild`, `ut_ui.add_ui_test_framework`; mixer from scenario-unity-gameplay. GATE: TMP Settings present.
3. **Build.** `UiTheme` tokens (8 px steps, one accent, one title level; Game Dev Guide). uGUI: `UIBuild.BuildMenuScene` or its helpers. UI Toolkit: `ut_ui.write_uitk_templates` then `UIToolkitBuild.BuildHud`. GATE: zero compile errors and warnings, `ImportReport` 0 errors with rules > 0 per sheet, `lint_uss`/`lint_uxml`/`lint_cs_events`/`lint_cs_queries` clean.
4. **Capture and assert.** `UICapture.CaptureUGUI` / `CaptureUITK` over `ut_ui.shots(...)`, HUD over a real level. GATE: `layout_verdict` empty, scale equals the formula, sheet and 4K crop looked at and critiqued ([`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md)); a collapse explained with `ExplainLayout`.
5. **Audit.** `UIAudit.Audit` with every locale's strings; `UIToolkitBuild.UitkGlyphs` for UI Toolkit text; `BindingSources` for data sources. GATE: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 missing glyphs in both systems, every source generated.
6. **Behavior.** Play Mode tests (selection, gamepad, hidden screens, settings, rebind, additive scene, bindings, layers and focus, locale) and Edit Mode UI Test Framework tests (clicks, keys, bindings, queried names). GATE: all pass.
7. **Cost.** `UIPerf.HideCost`, `TextEffectCost`, `PlayModeCounters` (counters, `list_markers`), `PanelChangeLog`. GATE: numbers against the budget, before and after each change.
8. **Deliver** with Verified and Assumed, and the handoff packets below.

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** compile clean; `layout_verdict` empty at every device; scale equals `canvas_scale` or `panel_scale`; `UIAudit` 0 errors and 0 warnings (sort ties, world canvases, static masks, center-anchored edges, atlas settings included); glyph gates 0 missing in TMP and UI Toolkit; USS rules kept; Play and Edit Mode tests 0 failures; static panel 1 batch; idle HUD 0 GC and 0 panel changes.
- **Visual:** the contact sheet and a 4K crop, judged on hierarchy, palette, contrast, spacing, same shape at every size, HUD readable over the level.

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from scenario-unity-architecture: models, events, the Input actions asset. From scenario-unity-gameplay: the AudioMixer with exposed MasterVol/MusicVol/SFXVol. From scenario-unity-rendering-lighting: quality levels (at runtime `QualitySettings.names` lists only the platform's levels). From artists, scenario-unity-2d or scenario-* skills: sprites and icons (atlased, rotation and tight packing off).
- **Delivers** to scenario-unity-mobile: one root per system for the safe-area panel (UI Toolkit: `RuntimePanelUtils.ScreenToPanel` with the y flip). To scenario-unity-performance: counter CSVs. To scenario-unity-shaders: UI Shader Graph or Canvas materials (minimap clip, blur). To scenario-unity-pipeline-automation: UI scenes, Play and Edit Mode tests for CI. Packet: scenes, capture sheets with the verdict, audit JSON, test totals, Verified and Assumed.

## Unity 6.3 notes

- TextMeshPro ships inside `com.unity.ugui` 2.0; in batch mode `TMP_PackageResourceImporter` finds no package path (`UISetup.ImportTmpEssentials`). `enableWordWrapping` is obsolete.
- `using UnityEngine.UI` with `UnityEngine.UIElements` makes `Image`, `Button`, `Slider` ambiguous (CS0104): alias them.
- Runtime binding since 6000.0; world-space UI Toolkit since 6.2; 6.3 adds UI Shader Graph, USS `filter`, `aspect-ratio`, SVG, the UI Test Framework package (`com.unity.ui.test-framework` 6.3.0, built in), and a stricter USS parser: any error leaves an EMPTY StyleSheet flagged `importedWithErrors` (measured). `PanelSettings.vertexBudget`, `textureSlotCount`, `SetPanelChangeReceiver` are public. Markers: `Scripts/UIElements.UpdateRuntimeBindings`, `.UpdateLayout`, `.UpdateStyle`.
- `EditorSceneManager.NewScene` unloads unreferenced assets: create the scene before loading the UXML.
- After 6.3: 6.5 Panel Renderer replaces UIDocument (which keeps working), uGUI Raycast Receiver; 6.6 removes UXML Factory/Traits (`[UxmlElement]` now).
