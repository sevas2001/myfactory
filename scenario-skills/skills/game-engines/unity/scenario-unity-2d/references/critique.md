# Critique rubric (scenario-unity-2d)

Score every 2D deliverable before calling it done. Each line has a measurable test (job, test or check) and, where the eye decides, what to look at in the capture. A deliverable passes when every "must" line passes; "should" lines need a written reason when they fail. Numbers come from the sources or from this skill's live runs (see `procedures.md`); [added] marks this skill's own thresholds.

## A. Import and assets

| #   | Must / should | Check                                  | Pass                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| A2  | must          | pivots of pixel sprites                | whole pixels (`pivots_whole_pixels` true); characters at the feet (8, 0 on a 16 px frame)                                         |
| A3  | must          | normal maps                            | referenced as `_NormalMap` secondary texture on the sprite asset, imported Normal map (plain PNG) or Sprite sRGB off (PSD layers) |
| A4  | should        | HD art PPU                             | = target height / (2 x smallest ortho size); sprites above 2x that PPU flagged as wasted memory [added]                           |
| A5  | must          | package manifest                       | no `com.unity.2d.pixel-perfect` in a URP project                                                                                  |

## B. Atlases

| #   | Must / should | Check                                 | Pass                                                                                                                                      |

| B5  | must          | the claim you make                    | atlas benefit stated as used / bound textures and memory; under the SRP Batcher neither Batches nor SetPass change (measured 21/21, 2/2)  |
| B6  | must          | pixel-art atlas pages                 | Compression None (or High Quality after a side-by-side check): compression shifts pixel colors                                            |
| B7  | should        | Analyzer parity                       | `AuditAtlases` findings resolved or justified (same reports as Window > Analysis > Sprite Atlas Analyzer, plus Read/Write off on sources) |

## C. Tilemaps and collision

| #   | Must / should | Check                              | Pass                                                                                                                                                                  |

| C7  | should        | per-tile colliders on shaped tiles | Use Delaunay Mesh on, custom physics outlines set (16 px sprites generate a rectangle); shape count reported                                                          |
| C8  | should        | AutoTile vs Rule Tile              | stated: AutoTile for a standard floor-layout sheet painted by a human; Rule Tile when scripted, directional, or per-rule colliders/outputs are needed                 |

## D. Lights

| #   | Must / should | Check                 | Pass                                                                                                                                                            |

| D6  | must          | `LightJobs.LightCost` | replica light batches = URP's count (engine_check); every batch break named and justified (a light that skips a layer redraws the others per batch)             |
| D7  | should        | fill                  | no light over half the view without a reason (`2d.light_large`); light_fill_screens compared before and after a change                                          |
| D8  | must          | tier                  | Normal Map Quality Fast (not Accurate) and 1 to 2 shadow lights on mobile or low tiers; `LightFillBench` or a device capture for the claim                      |

| F11 | must          | air friction                 | AirDeceleration chosen for the level; drift after release reported in body widths (Tarodev 30: 5.7; precision 240: 0.5)                                                                                       |
| F12 | must          | hazards                      | hitbox-to-art ratio below 1 on both axes; a graze test survives, a real overlap hits                                                                                                                          |
| F13 | should        | one-way platforms            | jump up through without a head bonk, land on top, Down + Jump drops through; casts ignore triggers                                                                                                            |

| --- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G1  | must          | `AnimJobs.LintAnimator` | 0 errors: sprite-to-sprite transitions exit time off and duration 0, Any State self-transition off, parameter names exist                |
| G2  | must          | parameters              | driven from controller outcome (grounded, velocity), not input; PlayMode: Jump state holds > 1 frame, Idle after landing                 |
| G3  | should        | clip rates              | 4 to 24 samples/s [added range]; 12 for sprite cycles                                                                                    |
| G4  | must          | hit stop                | restores the previous time scale, overlapping requests extend (measured 0.080 s for 0.05 then 0.06 at +0.02), a 0 multiplier disables it |
| G5  | must          | shake                   | a 0 multiplier gives zero offset (accessibility option); kick opposite to the shot; whole art pixels under Pixel Perfect                 |

## H. Report

- Every step names its Unity call (job name and API), then **Verified** (job ids, counts, measured numbers, contact sheets looked at) and **Assumed** (anything not run, GUI steps, feel verdicts left to a human).
- Performance: `AgentProfile.PlayModeTimings` + `ut_stat.summarize_csv` budget verdict, light batches and fill from `LightCost`; Editor numbers labeled as iteration numbers, device numbers handed to scenario-unity-performance.
