# Rendering and lighting (lighter / graphics TA)

Expert lighting in Unity is a measured loop: fix exposure, light to anchors, bake, grade, judging every stage from the same camera bookmarks with numbers (gray cards, clipping, bake memory, native passes) before taste. This skill drives URP 17.3 on Unity 6.3 from code; everything here ran in Unity 6000.3.21f1 on an Apple M5 Max (Metal) on 2026-09-24. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unity-expert (channels, `ut_run`, `AgentCapture`, `AgentProfile`, `ut_review`, 6.3 traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Exposure first, lights second** (Pierre Yves Donzallaz, yqCHiZrgKzs [00:20:21]). URP 6.3 has Fixed exposure only: one Post Exposure per zone, lights solved from an 18% gray card (the unaided sun 2.0 read +1.03 EV with no tonemapper; the solved 0.98 read +0.16 EV under Neutral).
2. **Expect gray after baking; fix it in post under the tonemapper you chose early** (Kyle Banks, 1agSNKuAfTM [00:04:58]; PYD [01:01:29]): Neutral for lookdev; contrast, saturation, Shadows Midtones Highlights pushed too far, then dialed back. ACES darkens (K3-wPnhmDi4 [00:54:50]; measured -1.4 EV): re-solve exposure under it.
3. **Shadow distance before resolution** (6.3 Manual; HCXCmHgV7Sk [00:15:32]): 1024 over 10 m beats 2048 over 40 m. Max Distance = farthest dynamic shadow the player sees; last cascade ends at the last caster. Stylized room with soft shadows: 1024 was the sweet spot, higher looked "too crisp" (URP e-book).
4. **The asset that renders is the Quality level's, and so is its post** (URPS [00:03:14], [00:30:06]). Report before editing. Unity 6 stacks the Graphics default profile, the active URP asset's profile, then scene volumes, per parameter: tier-dependent post (bloom cost, DoF, APV leak reduction) goes on each tier's asset profile, never in scene volumes, which win on every tier (measured). The template's two assets share one profile, and its Neutral tonemapper.
5. **Bake what does not move; split settings by cost** (Ciro Continisio, hMnetI4-dNY [00:35:51]): texel density, max size, directional mode and shadowmask cost memory, samples and bounces only bake time. Small props keep Contribute GI with Receive GI = Light Probes ([00:48:30]). A shadowmask texel holds 4 shadowed Mixed lights (6.3 Manual). Lightmaps sample 3 to 4 times cheaper than APV but take 3 times the memory (APV24 IpVuIZYFRg4 frame 00:23:43): phones keep lightmaps for static geometry.
6. **The sky is the default interior light** (PYD22 DlxuvvYZO4Q [00:08:17]; U25 [00:45:56]). Without baked GI and a local box probe, interiors and glossy surfaces take the sky (a smoothness-0.3 table read gray-blue until one probe existed).
7. **Stylized is a production choice, not a filter** (Kyle Banks [00:22:04] to [00:23:06]): one palette texture, triplanar world noise, one shared shader (7 samples over 3 textures, fine on Switch); Simple Lit on the low tier (URP e-book); Subtractive as the cheapest mixed mode (TRB). A toon shader must still sample lightmaps, shadowmask and probes or the bake vanishes; 6.3 builds custom lighting on the URP Unlit target (deltas section 5).
8. **On tilers, bandwidth is the budget; prove it** (6.3 Manual; U25 [00:30:26]; Ryan Keeble, bl0vKZkzNOs [00:14:30]): Forward, no depth or opaque texture unless needed (copy After Transparents), no soft shadows, MSAA 2x, 1 to 2 ms per extra full-screen pass on a Quest 2-class GPU. `PassAudit` reads the Render Graph's native passes: a depth copy After Opaques or the Opaque Texture splits the opaque, skybox and transparent pass (measured).

## Establish first

Ask once: platforms and device tiers (compute or GLES); frame budget (mobile at 65%); one emotion sentence (KB [00:03:25]), references, stylized or realistic; time of day; what moves; interiors; custom shaders; baked-memory budget.

## Workflow

Channel: `ut_run.run_method(P, "AgentKit.Lighting....", args, graphics=True)` for anything that renders or bakes; `-nographics` only for reports, tiers, volumes and audits (it cannot bake GI: `Bake` refuses). Plain command (`L.raw_command`): `Unity -batchmode -nographics -quit -projectPath P -logFile <job>/unity.log -executeMethod <method> -agentJob <job>`, args in `<job>/args.json`, result on the `AGENT_RESULT` line. Full code and results: [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md).

1. **Report the pipeline.** `LightingPipeline.ReportPipeline`: asset per level, renderer, features, asset profile, GRD prerequisites. GATE: every level has its own asset.
2. **Tiers as data.** `ConfigureTiers` (`asset_props`, `renderer_props`, `quality_props`, `renderer_features`, `volume_profile` + `volume_overrides`, project `graphics` for BRG variants and static batching), then ReportPipeline in a new process and `L.tier_check`. GATE: 0 mismatches, 0 errors (grading mismatch, GRD chain, APV masks without Use Rendering Layers).
3. **Bookmarks and cards.** `AgentView_*` cameras, gray cards (sun, shade, one per zone), a chrome ball indoors; `CaptureStage`. GATE: `L.stage_review` 0 errors; sheet opened.
4. **Exposure, then lights.** Lookdev volume (Neutral, fixed Post Exposure); sun `I * 2^-EV(card)`; other lights by ratio; zone exposure volumes at priority 1. GATE: sunlit card within half a stop; sun-to-shade at most 4 stops [added].
5. **Bake.** `LightingAudit.AuditLighting` first (contributors, lightmap UVs, shaders that cannot show or feed the bake, Shadowmask overlap, `style: "stylized"` rules), then `LightingBake.Bake` preview, then final. Verify the Lighting Mode each tier really renders with the shadowmask range scene (P13). GATE: bake report within budget, no UV warnings, audit 0 errors.
6. **Reflections and leaks.** Box probes per zone (importance 2, blend 0.25 m). Leak ladder: wall thickness near probe spacing, APV Options biases (0.1 / 0.175), Rendering Layer masks (`apv_layers`, max 4, rebake), Probe Adjustment Volume last (APV24 [00:18:13] to [00:23:13]). GATE: mid-smooth surfaces not sky-blue indoors (blue-minus-red at or below 0).
7. **Grade.** Final look in the scene volume, cost fields in the tier profiles, exposure re-solved. GATE: saturation and contrast above the baked stage, clipped at most 5%, cards in band.
8. **Measure.** `AgentProfile` + `ut_stat.budget_check`; `PassAudit` per tier; PC vs Mobile captures; a development player for tier-only oddities (P12) and the PSO trace and progressive warm-up (P15). GATE: budget as a trend, device verdict after a thermal soak with a vendor GPU capture (scenario-unity-mobile); Mobile within 0.35 EV and 15% saturation of PC [added].

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** fresh-process tier readback 0 mismatches; ReportPipeline and AuditLighting 0 errors; bake within budget; cards in band under the final tonemapper; clipped at most 5%, crushed at most 30%; chrome ball not sky-blue indoors; far shadows present where the tier promises them (P13); opaque, skybox and transparent in one native pass on phones; `budget_check` as a trend.
- **Visual:** the stage sheet after every stage; crisp shadows without acne or seams; no leaks at joints; no sky tint; the emotion sentence describes the frame; Mobile reads as the same image ([`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md)).

## Handoffs

- **Receives:** blockouts from scenario-unity-world-building (static flags, lightmap UVs checked here); shaders from scenario-unity-shaders (DepthOnly, DepthNormals, Meta passes; LIGHTMAP_ON and SHADOWS_SHADOWMASK variants when lightmapped); budgets from scenario-unity-performance and scenario-unity-mobile.
- **Delivers:** tiers (JSON spec + readback), tier profiles, bakes with their report, stage sheets, pass audits. To scenario-unity-shaders: the stylized shading brief (palette, shared shader, ramp on the URP Unlit target that samples lightmaps, shadowmask and APV; Simple Lit variants for the low tier) and Render Graph passes. To scenario-unity-performance: GRD bench CSVs and GPU questions. To scenario-unity-mobile: the Mobile tier, PSO traces per graphics API, the thermal soak and vendor GPU captures (Xcode, Android GPU Inspector, Arm Performance Studio, Snapdragon Profiler). To scenario-unity-pipeline-automation: raw command lines for CI. 2D Renderer lights: scenario-unity-2d.

## Unity 6.3 notes

- Render Graph only; `_CLUSTER_LIGHT_LOOP` replaces `_FORWARD_PLUS`. The Render Graph Viewer can attach to a device player; `PassAudit` reads internals by reflection (`available: false` if they move).
- URP exposure Fixed only, no physical light units, SSR or volumetrics; HDRP in maintenance; Built-in deprecated in 6.5.
- The feature table says Distance Shadowmask is "Forward rendering path only" (it says the same of MSAA); on 6000.3.21f1 it rendered on Forward+ exactly as on Forward (P13).
- GPU lightmapper only on Apple Silicon; CPU lightmapper deprecated in 6.6; OptiX deprecated in 6.5.
- Bloom `filter`: Gaussian, Dual, Kawase (new in 6.3). `GraphicsStateCollection` is experimental. `APVLeakReductionMode.ValidityBased` is an obsolete alias that `ToString()` prints for Performance.
- Dynamic batching deprecated in 6.5. STP forces TAA, needs compute, never GLES.
