Also when 'my save works in the Editor but not in the build', statics keep values on the second Play, events fire twice or never, an await runs after its object died, rebinds are lost on relaunch, a renamed class loses its data, a scene merge breaks."

# Unity architecture (gameplay programmer / architect)

Expert architecture in Unity is judged by what survives the edges: the second Play session, a destroyed object mid-await, a relaunch of the built player, a class rename, a merge of two branches, a prefab dropped into an empty scene. Data lives in assets, state lives in plain C# and files, systems talk through events they do not own, and every claim is pinned by a test the agent can run without a mouse. Target: Unity 6000.3.21f1, Input System 1.20.0, Test Framework 1.6.0, macOS. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unity-expert (channels, review loop, 6.3 traps). Toolkit: `ut_env`, `ut_run`, `ut_live` plus this skill's [`scripts/ut_arch.py`](scripts/ut_arch.py), [`scripts/AgentKit/Architecture/`](scripts/AgentKit/Architecture/) jobs and [`scripts/templates/`](scripts/templates/) (a tested Game.Core / Game.Runtime / Game.Editor / tests layout).

**Status (2026-09-24):** every procedure ran in Unity 6000.3.21f1 on this Mac: `tests/code/unity-architecture/run_all.sh --live` (results in `archive/tests/unity-architecture/live_results.jsonl`).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **ScriptableObjects are definitions, never saves.** Play-mode writes to an SO persist in the Editor and reset on every launch of a build (Code Monkey, 5a-ztc5gcFw [00:04:17]). Observed sharper: the write lives only in Editor memory (`IsDirty` false, the `.asset` unchanged even after `SaveAssets`), so a file hash never sees it; only an in-memory guard in the process that plays does (`so_guard`, the prefab SO test). A macOS player run twice started from the baked value while the save FILE carried over. Runtime modifiers apply to a struct copy (`config.Stats`, Tarodev, tE1qH8OxO2Y [00:11:18]); live registries are runtime sets, never scene searches (Hipple, raQ3iHhE_Kk [00:40:06]). Saves: versioned JSON of ids, atomic write, backup, migrations.
2. **Read Enter Play Mode before trusting any Play test.** With domain reload off (an option in 6.3, the default for new 6.6 projects) a static counter read 2 and a static event had 2 subscribers on the second Play (observed). Unregister static handlers on `ExitingPlayMode` (the Manual's best practice; observed clean on its own) and reset values at `SubsystemRegistration`; `DoublePlay` proves both. Scene reload off makes Editor startup unrepresentative, and a script change still reloads the domain (6.3 Manual).
3. **Every await has an owner.** Awaits survive Destroy and Play exit (Unity, eXkFPoEp3BA [00:13:28]): a token-less loop ticked 13 to 14 more times in the 0.3 s after `Destroy` (observed). MonoBehaviours pass `destroyCancellationToken` (`Lifetime.Linked(this)` when IO must also stop at exit); plain C# services pass `Application.exitCancellationToken`. Never await an Awaitable twice (pooled: `AsTask()`), never block on a Task. Release players skip the main-thread check: off the main thread a development player threw on `persistentDataPath`, `Time.time`, `transform` and `new GameObject`, the release player threw nothing (observed). Smoke-test threading in a development build.
4. **Designers wire, code decides.** Serialized SO references are the injector designers can see (Hipple [00:14:39]). Channels decouple sender and receivers, iterate listeners backwards ([00:33:23]) and ship a debug plan: counts, a log toggle, `RaiseDebug()` from a job, an inspector button ([00:36:07]). UnityEvent is a serialized function call ([00:29:26]): rare designer-wired responses only (0 B per invoke measured on 6.3, but targets are hard references resolved by method name). One composition root runs first (`[DefaultExecutionOrder(-1000)]`, git-amend, PJcBJ60C970 [00:12:01]; without it a consumer found nothing, observed) and fails loudly. Each prefab runs alone in an empty scene ([00:16:29]). Statics suit a small solo project only (Weimann, hQE8lQk9ikE [00:01:28]; Tarodev [00:03:00]), with resets. Enums only for sets fixed "by some law"; categories designers extend become SO assets ([00:46:39]).
5. **Rebinding is a state machine with six traps.** The action must be disabled (the package throws otherwise); Escape does not cancel a Button rebind by default; a composite head cannot be rebound; duplicates are judged on `effectivePath`, composite parts only against earlier parts, modifier combos per `shortcutKeysConsumeInput` (off by default: Shift+B also fires B); Reset All deletes the persisted overrides; `LoadBindingOverridesFromJson` wipes existing overrides unless passed `false` (samyam, csqVa2Vimao [00:12:51], [00:27:44], [00:33:22]; 1.20 manual; all tested). For the UI, start from the Rebinding UI sample: in 1.20 it already disables and disposes but lacks four fixes (`ut_arch.rebind_audit`). Each `new` of a generated input class is a separate asset: share one.
6. **Assemblies are a contract.** A Core with `noEngineReferences` holds rules testable in milliseconds; runtime asmdefs never reference editor ones (the Editor compiles it, the player build fails, observed). Test asmdefs reference `Unity.InputSystem.TestFramework`; `testables` was not needed on 6000.3.21f1 (observed).
7. **Serialized data survives refactors and merges only on purpose.** `[FormerlySerializedAs]` for fields, `[MovedFrom]` for renamed `[SerializeReference]` classes (without it the entry loaded as null, observed), `[Serializable]` on every `[SerializeReference]` type (6.3 tolerated its absence; 6.4 requires it per the version notes). UnityYAMLMerge exits 2 on any conflicted field even with `-l`/`-r`, and without them writes the BASE value (observed): check the exit code, then open the result in Unity.

## Establish first

Team shape (who wires behavior: designers or programmers), project lifetime, target platforms (Web has no managed threads), Enter Play Mode setting, input devices (keyboard-mouse, gamepad, touch, local multiplayer) and modifier shortcuts, save needs (slots, cloud, migrations), VCS (Git + LFS by default). Defaults: project-wide actions, Game.Core/Runtime/Editor/Tests asmdefs, SO definitions + plain C# state, event channels between systems, runtime sets for registries, one `GameRoot`, JSON saves under `persistentDataPath`, Git with the UnityYAMLMerge driver. Run `ArchJobs.ProjectFacts` and write its answers into the plan.

## Workflow

1. **Scaffold and compile.** Goal: rules in pure C#. How: `ut_arch.install(P)`, `ut_arch.scaffold(P)` (A1), then `ArchJobs.ProjectFacts` (`Unity -batchmode -nographics -quit -executeMethod AgentKit.Architecture.ArchJobs.ProjectFacts`). GATE: zero compile errors and warnings; `ArchJobs.AssemblyGraph`: Game.Core `engine_refs == 0`, `violations == []`.
2. **Data as assets.** Goal: definitions designers edit. How: `ArchJobs.CreateAssets` with `ut_arch.item_specs()` (`SerializedObject` edits, `managed_refs` for `[SerializeReference]` lists, SetDirty only on change) (A2, A13). GATE: second run all `unchanged`; `ItemDatabaseValidator` clean.
3. **Core systems with tests.** Goal: inventory, health, events, sets. How: templates; `ut_run.run_tests(P, "EditMode", assemblies="Game.Tests.EditMode")`. GATE: all pass; `ut_arch.code_lint` no warn or error in runtime code (A10).
4. **Save and load.** Goal: state that survives relaunch. How: `SaveService` (A3). GATE: EditMode round trip, corrupt-file fallback, v1 migration; `CrossProcessSave` across two editor processes; a player run twice for persistence claims (A4); a development player when saves touch threads (A12).
5. **Input.** Goal: every device, rebinding that persists and resets. How: project-wide actions, `InputContext`, `RebindFlow`, `BindingStore`, `.inputactions` edited as JSON; `ArchInputAudit.Audit` (A5, A15). GATE: `InputTestFixture` tests per trap; audit without `missing_scheme` or `duplicate_binding`; `rebind_audit` missing nothing.
6. **Async and lifecycle.** Goal: no orphan work. How: `async Awaitable Start()` with a token, `AsTask`, PlayMode suite; async tests as a `[UnityTest]` returning the inner Awaitable, or `async Task` (A6, A7, A14). GATE: no tick after Destroy; prefab isolation and prefab SO guard pass.
7. **Play-mode hardening.** Goal: session 2 equals session 1, events reach responses. How: `ArchJobs.StaticStateAudit`, then `ArchPlayMode.DoublePlay` with `so_guard` and `invoke` (`RaiseDebug` on each channel) in the project's mode (A8, A11). GATE: no `arch.static_without_reset` in own assemblies; watched values equal across sessions; `so_changed_in_memory == []`; every invoke `ok` with its response counted.
8. **Version control.** Goal: merges and moves never break references. How: `ArchJobs.SetVcsSettings`, `ut_arch.write_vcs_files`, `git_setup_unity_merge`, `meta_audit`, `yaml_merge`, then `ArchJobs.InspectAsset` (A9). GATE: `meta_audit.ok`; `.meta` not in LFS; clean merges exit 0 and deserialize; conflicts stay unmerged with a report.
9. **Hand off with evidence** (scenario-unity-expert report format): Unity call per step, Verified, Assumed.

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** zero compile errors and warnings; `AssemblyGraph.violations == []`; EditMode and PlayMode `failed == 0` in the full suite, not only single tests; `code_lint` no warn or error in runtime code; `so_guard` and the prefab SO test clean (`SnapshotAssets` `changed_on_disk == []` only proves editor tools saved nothing); `StaticStateAudit` clean; `DoublePlay` sessions equal; `ArchInputAudit` warn 0; `rebind_audit` complete; `meta_audit.ok`; merge exit codes checked; player relaunch report (A4) and development-player report (A12) when persistence or threads are claimed.
- **Visual (few):** after a scene merge, a camera capture before and after (scenario-unity-expert `AgentCapture`); a rebinding screen shows the new binding text (scenario-unity-ui).

## Handoffs

- **Receives from** scenario-unity-expert: brief, channel, project facts. From scenario-unity-gameplay: which systems need health, damage, state machines (the FSM pattern lives there).
- **Delivers to** scenario-unity-ui: `RebindFlow`, `BindingStore`, `InputContext`, channels (with `RaiseDebug`) for HUD and settings screens, with tests. To scenario-unity-gameplay: `IDamageable`, `Health`, `Services`, `GameRoot`, runtime sets. To scenario-unity-pipeline-automation: asmdef layout, `run_tests(..., assemblies=...)`, development builds, `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes`, merge driver. To scenario-unity-performance: GC per frame (scenario-unity-expert `AgentProfile`), per-object Awaitable loops. To scenario-unity-web: no managed threads (SaveAsync stays synchronous, no `Task.Delay`). To scenario-unity-mobile: touch schemes, `persistentDataPath`. Packet: files written, tests with totals, audits with counts, Verified and Assumed.

## Unity 6.3 notes

- Enter Play Mode is a dropdown ("When entering Play Mode"); 6.6 new projects default to "Reload Scene only"; 6.5 adds code lifecycle attributes and `AutoStaticsCleanup`.
- `FindObjectsByType<T>(FindObjectsSortMode.None)` (the sort mode is obsolete from 6.4); `[SerializeField]` only on fields; `GetInstanceID` becomes a compile error in 6.5 (`EntityId`); `[SerializeReference]` types must be `[Serializable]` from 6.4 (version notes, unverified there).
- Templates run the Input System only (legacy `Input.*` throws); Input System 1.20 bundled; `OnMouseDown` works with it only from 6.4.
- `Object.Destroy`: verified live on 6000.3.21f1 (`LifecycleTests`, 2026-09-24) that `OnDisable` reaches every descendant (four levels); the 6.4 upgrade guide and the version notes describe pre-6.4 editors as "only direct children", so keep the idempotent `OnDestroy` unregistration for older editors.
- Force Text and Visible Meta Files are the 6.3 defaults (observed); 6.6 turns YAML word wrap off and removes "Reduce Version Control Noise".
