# Critique rubric: judging a pipeline, a layout, a build, a release

Score each line pass / warn / fail with its evidence (envelope field, NUnit total, layout number, frame you opened). A pipeline is done when every "must" line passes; a warn needs a written reason. Thresholds are this skill's defaults unless the brief sets others.

## 1. Import rules

| Check                                                                                            | Must                                        | Evidence                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rules live in one versioned file read by the postprocessor, the jobs and the tests               | yes                                         | `Assets/Settings/Pipeline/prop_import_rules.json`, `context.DependsOnSourceAsset` in the postprocessor           |
| Importer settings set in `OnPreprocess*`, never in `OnPostprocess*`                              | yes                                         | code review                                                                                                      |

| No asset creation, move or reimport inside import callbacks; no clocks, no unsorted dictionaries | yes                                         | grep for `CreateAsset                                                                                            | MoveAsset | ImportAsset | DateTime | Dictionary` in postprocessors |

| Source textures above the budget are capped by the importer, not resized by hand                 | yes                                         | audit `clamped` lists source vs imported size                                                                    |
| Model transforms: rotation 0, scale 1 on every node                                              | warn allowed with a named re-export request | audit `pipeline.rotation`, `pipeline.transform_scale`                                                            |
| Importers proven deterministic after any postprocessor or ScriptedImporter change                | yes                                         | `up.consistency_check`: summary line seen, nothing flagged under `Assets/` (package paths in a written baseline) |
| Only import settings in the rules file the postprocessor depends on                              | yes                                         | gate and release settings live in `pipeline_checks.json`; a rules edit reimports every governed asset            |
| Postprocessor changes batched: one `GetVersion()` bump per change set                            | warn                                        | counters of the next launch (a bump reimports every asset of that importer type, packages included)              |

## 2. Naming and the drop

| Check                                                                                  | Must | Evidence                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| Every reject has a reason; nothing ambiguous is guessed (duplicates reject all copies) | yes  | ImportDrop `rejected`                   |
| Renames are listed (from, to) and reproducible offline                                 | yes  | `renamed`, same result from `scan_drop` |

| Rejected props already in the project are flagged, never deleted                       | yes  | props manifest `status: rejected`       |

## 3. Scripted edits (editor tools, agent jobs)

| Check                                                                                                                               | Must                | Evidence                                                                                        |

| Structure changes through `Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo`, `AddComponent`, `SetTransformParent`, `DestroyObjectImmediate`          | yes (user's editor) | code review                                                                                     |

| Prefab assets edited with LoadPrefabContents / SaveAsPrefabAsset / UnloadPrefabContents, not by instantiating into the user's scene | yes                 | code review                                                                                     |

| Second run changes nothing                                                                                                          | yes                 | `diff_hashes(before, after)["count"] == 0`, and `git status --porcelain` empty in a repo        |

| Pipeline code that tests must call is in an Editor asmdef, its tests in a test asmdef                                               | yes (project code)  | asmdef JSON; no test asmdef naming Assembly-CSharp or Assembly-CSharp-Editor types              |

## 4. Addressables layout

| Check                                                                             | Must | Evidence                                                                                               |

| Bytes loaded per label within the brief's budget; worst label reported            | yes  | `layout.per_label`                                                                                     |

| Tiny condition groups merged when their overhead matters                          | warn | bundle count, per-label deltas                                                                         |
| Typed `AssetReference` or labels in runtime code, no string literals              | yes  | grep `LoadAssetAsync<...>("`                                                                           |
| Every load has a release path; nothing `WaitForCompletion` on WebGL or in `Awake` | yes  | code review; player smoke unload                                                                       |

| Labels and groups created in ordinal order by the assignment script               | yes  | code review (the label table keeps insertion order; entries and groups are sorted by GUID on save)     |
| No group asset created or copied under `Assets/` outside the settings' folder     | yes  | Addressables adopts any imported group into the default settings                                       |
| No build scene references Addressable content                                     | yes  | `up.hard_references` ok; `AGENT_GATE.hard_references == 0`; shader-only references listed as a warning |

Other layout pitfalls to call out: a few props shared across biomes left in their folder group (loading one biome loads another biome's whole bundle): label them and pack by condition.

## 5. Content build and CI

## 7. Report

- Each step names its Unity call (toolkit call plus the API or command line behind it), then **Verified** (what ran, job id, numbers, frame) and **Assumed** (not run, `[verify]`, defaults, numbers quoted from a source).
- Numbers are relative to something: "4.8 MB for the dungeon label (was 12.9 MB with the isolation group)", never "smaller bundles".
