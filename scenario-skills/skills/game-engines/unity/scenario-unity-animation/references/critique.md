# Critique rubric (judge your own animation work before calling it done)

Score every stage. A stage passes only when every measurable line passes and every visual line was checked on a contact sheet you opened. Write the result into the handoff as Verified (with numbers and sheet paths) or Assumed.

## Verdict words

- **Pass**: all measurable lines pass and the sheets were opened.
- **Warn**: a line fails with a stated reason the user accepted (for example a stylized snap).
- **Fail**: any error finding, a T-pose or bind pose on a sheet, a head or hand off target, a camera flip or swing through the target, a missing marker, an idle that drifts.
