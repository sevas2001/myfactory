# Unity performance (performance engineer)

Expert performance work is a measurement discipline: a budget in milliseconds, the bounding thread named before any change, the biggest measured cost fixed first, structure before tuning, and every fix proven with before/after numbers from a development player. An agent does all of it headless: `AgentProfile` in Editor Play mode to iterate, `PerfProbe` in a batch-mode player for verdicts, `PerfCapture` to attribute costs from a Profiler capture, `metal_trace` for GPU time, `PerfBuild` for size. Target: Unity 6000.3.21f1, URP 17.3, macOS Apple Silicon. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unity-expert (channels, review loop, 6.3 traps, `ut_*` toolkit).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Name the bound before touching anything.** "If you speed up the GPU when your profile looks like this it's not going to run any faster" (Peter Hall, Unity Profiler team, _cV1B2hqXGI [00:05:50]). Observed: removing 1.36 MB of garbage per frame did not move a frame bound by 5,946 SetPass calls. GPU bound needs GPU timing; the Frame Debugger has none (Hall [frame 00:09:18]).
2. **Players decide, the Editor iterates.** The authority is a development build on the lowest target device (profiling e-book p. 18). GRD: 4.4x in a 2M-instance stress test, 2.07x in the Editor but 1.45x standalone in a real game (Oc6T4hh5gaI [frame 00:12:41]); here the Editor swung 1.5x to 3.0x, players 1.9x to 2.8x on a stress fixture. Forecast about 1.5x.
3. **GC.Alloc sample time is not the cost.** Unity records only timestamp and size (e-book p. 27): 54,021 allocations shown as 1.01 ms caused 19.97 ms of `GC.Collect` (Hall [frame 00:21:52]). Observed: 27,000 allocations per frame displayed 0.8 to 1.1 ms; the allocating code cost 3.8 to 5.4 ms. Count bytes and calls, measure collections, target 0 B per gameplay frame, and keep the probe itself allocation-free (git-amend ham_w48aRJ4 [00:11:30]).
4. **6.3 URP draw calls = SRP Batcher + GPU Resident Drawer; the 2024 advice is Built-in-only.** Material "Enable GPU Instancing" off, static batching off, no MaterialPropertyBlock (6.3 Manual table). GRD silently does nothing unless BatchRendererGroup Variants = Keep All and every renderer of the URP asset is Forward+ or Deferred+ (URP 17.3 source, observed). Then prove coverage: GRD draws are named "Hybrid Batch Group" in the Frame Debugger (GUI editor only), each other draw is a renderer that fell out (MPB, LPPV, realtime GI, non-DOTS shader, skinned; 6.3 Manual); headless, check eligibility per renderer after `Start`.
5. **Data layout first; spreading work over frames hides cost.** 200,000 objects: MonoBehaviour Update 27 ms to 0.13 ms through manager, structs, Burst, SoA; "it's just spreading the work around" (Jason Booth, NAVbI1HIzCE [00:06:38]-[00:18:17]).
6. **Attribute every hitch before fixing it, with markers kept in code.** Streaming and spawn systems carry their own ProfilerMarkers and counters; Deep Profile only finds what fills a gap (Hall [00:18:39]-[00:19:12]). Compiles show as `Shader.CreateGPUProgram` (warm a traced GraphicsStateCollection during loading, Nicolas Borromeo CmD8MVGkDxQ [00:11:14]-[00:14:35]); here warm-up removed all 18 first-use compiles, yet the first frame stayed about 250 ms on `Mono.JIT`.
7. **Resident memory kills, untracked usually does not.** 0.75 GB untracked was 140 MB resident (Borromeo [00:32:22]); Editor memory is about 5x the player's (Uuzd39AjFWQ [00:10:03]). On a laptop, paging and VRAM overflow are stutter causes of their own.
8. **Counts are exact, times drift [added, observed].** On a shared machine (load average 50 to 210 here), interleave A/B runs and require a consistent sign.

## Establish first

Target platforms and min-spec device per tier; frame budget (16.67 ms desktop, mobile x 0.65); resolution and quality tier; what may change (code only, or art, design, feel); a repeatable benchmark, time-based when judging streaming (a fixed step per frame reaches boundaries sooner after a speed-up) [added]; scripting backend and build type; the machine actually measured (discrete GPU, on power; probe JSON `device`) [added]. Defaults: PC-tier URP asset, 60 fps, 1920x1080, development Mono player for iteration, IL2CPP release for size.

## Workflow

1. **Budget and benchmark.** GATE: a baseline CSV.
2. **Iterate in the Editor.** `ut_perf.profile` (render=False isolates scripts), `ab_profile` for time deltas. GATE: numbers labeled "Editor, iteration".
3. **Static baseline.** `PerfRendering.Audit` (batching, GRD eligibility per renderer, graphics jobs per platform, Build Profile, stack traces, upload buffer, culling), `lint_scripts`, Project Auditor (`project_auditor`, Major first, `triage_auditor` keeps per-frame lines), `PerfAudit.AudioImport`, `bundle_duplicates`. GATE: findings triaged by call frequency.
4. **Measure the player.** `build_player(development=True)`, `run_player(..., shot=png, markers=[...])`. GATE: `draw_calls` > 0, PNG opened, `budget_check`.
5. **Classify the bound.** Capture wait markers (`capture_player`, `analyze_capture`), longest vs median frame. GPU: `metal_trace` + `metal_gpu_frames` (GPU busy and per-pass ms; Rendering Debugger Display Stats in the GUI), then the pixel-bound test (4K vs 1080p, render scale). GATE: bound named with a number.
6. **Attribute.** `attribute_spikes` (your markers, GC.Collect, compiles, MeshCollider cooking, synchronous reads, physics steps), `physics_catchup`, `memory_budget`, `density_check`, allocations per block (`AllocScope`, `Is.Not.AllocatingGCMemory()`), GRD coverage (`PerfFrameDebug.Capture` or the window). GATE: top three costs named, no unexplained spike.
7. **Fix one thing at a time, structure first.** Scripts: allocations, managers, then Burst. Render CPU: Material Variants, SRP Batcher shaders, `EnableGpuResidentDrawer`, one camera, Split graphics jobs on DX12/Vulkan. GPU: dynamic resolution or STP, depth priming and less transparency, LOD where triangles are pixel-sized, post-processing on a fixed slice; shadows with scenario-unity-rendering-lighting. Hitches: async loads, prewarmed pools, PSO warm-up in loading, baked MeshColliders, audio load types, no duplicated bundle dependencies. GATE: `compare_line` shows the target down, nothing else up, image parity.
8. **Ship config.** IL2CPP release, stripping and code generation chosen, variants stripped against the used set (P15), flags through `BuildPlayerOptions` (platform profiles share settings). GATE: build succeeded, size explained, smoke run clean.
9. **Guard.** Allocation tests and Performance Testing sample groups per commit, lint on changed scripts. GATE: tests pass.

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** player `budget_check` pass (p95 under budget, no gameplay hitch); `gc_check` pass in the player; `attribute_spikes` unexplained = 0; `physics_steps` at most 1 outside a forced spike; `memory_budget` pass; `density_check` pass; `PerfRendering.Audit` counts.error == 0 and every GRD fallout explained; 0 `Shader.CreateGPUProgram` after loading; no new Major Project Auditor issue in your code; IL2CPP build within budget.
- **Visual:** the player's last frame (`-perfShot`) and Editor captures from the same bookmarks before and after, `ut_review.compare`, contact sheet opened; no blank, uniform or magenta frame.

## What not to change without sign-off

Game feel (fixed timestep, Maximum Allowed Timestep, animation timing, input, AI ticks); art direction (texture sizes, lights, LOD thresholds, render scale) without before/after captures; the pipeline, engine version or an ECS rewrite; incremental GC off unless gameplay allocates 0 B in the player and an A/B shows the gain; `asyncUploadBufferSize` raised blindly (never returned, console e-book p. 31); VSync off in release; the benchmark path between before and after.

## Handoffs

- **Receives:** the brief in numbers from scenario-unity-expert; systems code from scenario-unity-architecture and scenario-unity-gameplay; pipeline assets from scenario-unity-rendering-lighting; shaders from scenario-unity-shaders; effects from scenario-unity-vfx; UI from scenario-unity-ui; bundles and Addressables from scenario-unity-pipeline-automation.
- **Delivers:** the bound, attributed costs, before/after tables, CSVs, traces, PNGs: variant stripping to scenario-unity-shaders, lighting, shadow and post cuts to scenario-unity-rendering-lighting, overdraw budgets to scenario-unity-vfx and scenario-unity-ui, physics settings to scenario-unity-gameplay, duplicate fixes, CI perf tests and build profiles to scenario-unity-pipeline-automation, device and thermal validation to scenario-unity-mobile, Web limits to scenario-unity-web.

## Unity 6.3 notes

- SRP Batcher + GRD + GPU occlusion (the 17.3 URP asset holds the occlusion flag); dynamic batching deprecated in 6.5, obsolete in 6.6.
- Split graphics jobs is the default on DX12/Vulkan/consoles (Oc6T4hh5gaI [00:03:04]); the 6.3 URP template reads Windows on/Split, Android off/Native, Metal off/Native; per-platform getters are internal (observed).
- `GraphicsStateCollection` is experimental, traces only in development players; WebGPU tracing in 6.4. `FrameDebuggerUtility` is internal.
- Profile Analyzer 1.4.0, Memory Profiler 1.1.12, Project Auditor 1.0.2 (built in from 6.4), Performance Testing 3.5.0 (core in 6.6) and Profiling Core 1.0.3 (needed for `ProfilerCounterValue`) are preinstalled packages added by name.
- Mesh LOD is 6.2+. `Physics.BakeMesh(int, bool)` is obsolete: pass `mesh.GetEntityId()`. 6.3 runs Boehm (non-generational); CoreCLR is future work.
