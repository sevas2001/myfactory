# GUI paths (for a computer-use agent or a human)

The same procedures as `procedures.md`, through menus. UE 5.8 on macOS: the 5.6 viewport toolbar redesign moved the view mode, exposure and show menus (`ToolMenusViewportToolbars 0` restores the old toolbars); Ctrl shortcuts in Epic's docs usually map to Cmd on Mac [verify]. Paths come from the 5.8 docs quoted in the notes; wording may differ slightly in the installed editor [verify].

## Project settings (P1)

- Edit > Project Settings > Engine > Rendering:
  - Global Illumination: Dynamic Global Illumination Method = Lumen; Reflection Method = Lumen.
  - Lumen: Use Hardware Ray Tracing when available; Ray Lighting Mode (Surface Cache or Hit Lighting for Reflections); Software Ray Tracing Mode (Global Tracing is the 5.7+ default).
  - Hardware Ray Tracing: Support Hardware Ray Tracing (restart); Path Tracing (shader permutations; off if never used).
  - Direct Lighting > MegaLights (accept the prompt to enable Support Hardware Ray Tracing).
  - Shadows: Shadow Map Method = Virtual Shadow Maps.
  - Software Ray Tracing: Generate Mesh Distance Fields.
  - Default Settings: Extend default luminance range in Auto Exposure settings (at project start only); Alpha Output; Support Primitive Alpha Holdout (Deferred); default light units.
  - Optimizations: Support Compute Skin Cache (path tracer prompt).
  - Fog: Support Sky Atmosphere Affecting Height Fog (restart).
  - Materials: Energy Conservation (off by default).
- Device profiles: Platforms menu > Device Profiles, or edit `Config/<Platform>/<Platform>DeviceProfiles.ini` (`+CVars=sg.GlobalIlluminationQuality=2`).

## Exposure and look (P2, P10)

- Place Actors (Window > Place Actors, or the toolbar Quick Add) > Visual Effects > Post Process Volume; Details > Infinite Extent (Unbound), Priority.

- Viewport: view mode menu > Exposure > Game Settings (otherwise the PPV is bypassed); the EV100 override ignores Exposure Compensation.
- Show > Visualize > HDR (Eye Adaptation): histogram, target line, lux and nits meter at screen center. Show > Visualize > Local Exposure.
- CineCamera Actor Details > Current Camera Settings (Filmback, Focal Length, Current Aperture); Post Process > Lens > Exposure for the still's Manual metering with physical camera; 5.7+ Exposure Method on the camera.

  - Sky Light: Real Time Capture, Source Type, Cubemap Resolution, Sky Distance Threshold, Lower Hemisphere Is Solid Color, Recapture.
- Exponential Height Fog: Fog Density, Height Falloff, Fog Inscattering Color, Directional Inscattering Color, Volumetric Fog (Scattering Distribution: near 0.9 when the key camera looks into the light, near 0 for side views; Albedo, Extinction Scale, View Distance); 5.8 Fog Screen Space Scattering (Experimental).
- Lighting channels: light Details > Advanced > Lighting Channels (Channel 0 off, Channel 1 on for a still-only cheat); the hero mesh's Details > Lighting > Lighting Channels (Channel 0 and 1 on).
- Stationary light overlap: viewport view mode > Optimization Viewmodes > Stationary Light Overlap; Light Complexity in the same menu.
- Niagara light renderer (from scenario-unreal-vfx): emitter stack > Light Renderer > Allow Mega Lights, Mega Lights Cast Shadows, shadow casting.

## Representation views (P7 to P9)

- View Modes > Lumen > Overview, Lumen Scene, Surface Cache (pink = no cards), Performance Overview; Show > Lumen > Screen Traces toggle.
- Show > Visualize > Mesh Distance Fields, Global Distance Field.
- View Modes > MegaLights > Light Complexity (hover a pixel: lines to the lights and a weight list), Overview, Shadow Caster, Shadow Caster Mismatch; 5.8 light finder and ray visualizer tools.
- View Modes > Virtual Shadow Map > Cached Page (green cached, red invalidated, blue static), Shadow Casters.
- Show > Visualize > Sky Atmosphere; 5.8 Show > Visualize > Color Grading (ColorParade, VectorScope, ColorHistogram); Post Process Stack with `r.PostProcessing.Debug.Property`.
- Static Mesh Editor > Build Settings > Max Lumen Mesh Cards, Distance Field Resolution Scale, Two-Sided Distance Field Generation; Nanite Settings > Fallback Target = Relative Error, Fallback Relative Error, Apply Changes.
- Component Details: Emissive Light Source (small emissive meshes in the Lumen Scene), Visible in Ray Tracing, Affect Distance Field Lighting, Shadow Cache Invalidation Behavior, World Position Offset Disable Distance.
- Albedo: viewport view mode > Buffer Visualization > Base Color (read it next to the chart of the calibrator); material instance Details > Base Color parameters.
- Chrome ball and chart: hold backslash in the viewport for the calibration chart [verify in 5.8], or place `/Engine/EditorMeshes/ColorCalibrator/SM_ColorCalibrator`.

## Path tracer and Movie Render Graph (P13)

- Viewport view mode > Path Tracing; PPV Details > Path Tracing: Max Bounces, Samples Per Pixel (viewport only), Max Path Intensity, Emissive Materials (the double-count A/B), Reference Depth of Field, Reference Atmosphere, Denoiser, Lighting Components (untick Indirect Emissive when fixtures carry real lights).
- Glass master (Material Editor, Details of the material node): Blend Mode Translucent, Lighting Mode Surface ForwardShading, Refraction Method Index of Refraction; Shading Model Thin Translucent only for thin films.
- Sky Atmosphere Details > Transform Mode = Planet Top at Component Transform (Reference Atmosphere).
- Window > Cinematics > Movie Render Queue (or Sequencer toolbar > Render). 5.8 opens the Basic configuration: name, resolution, location, renderer (deferred or path tracer), output type. Settings dropdown > Movie Render Graph to use a graph; Content Browser > Cinematics > Movie Render Graph to create one.
- Graph editor: Tab or right-click for nodes; Members panel for Outputs and Variables; right-click a node property > expose as pin, right-click the pin > Promote to Variable; right-click a node > Disable; Evaluate Graph under Active Render Settings; the collection details arrow selects matched actors in the Outliner.
- Render differs from the viewport: right-click Global Game Overrides > Disable (or disconnect it) and render again, before any other change.
- Nodes: Global Output Settings (resolution, Flush Disk Writes Per Shot), Warm Up Settings, Sampling Method (temporal samples), Global Game Overrides, Set CVar / Apply CVar Preset / Start and End Console Commands, Render Layer, Deferred Renderer or Path Traced Renderer (spatial samples, AA method, Disable Tone Curve, denoiser, Lighting Components), Collection, Modifier (Holdout, Is Hidden, Cast Shadows While Hidden, Affect Indirect While Hidden), 5.8 Light Modifier, EXR and EXR Multilayer (DWAA/DWAB in 5.8), Execute Script (Editor Only mode for Python), Debug Settings (Write All Samples, Insights trace).
- Render (Local) renders in-process from unsaved state; Render (Remote) reads saved assets and prints its command line to the Output Log (a template for farm scripts). Quick Render: main toolbar, three-dots menu.

## Profiling (P12, handed to scenario-unreal-performance)

- Console (backquote): `stat unit`, `stat gpu`, `ProfileGPU` (opens the GPU Visualizer; 5.8 adds pipe waits and `r.ProfileGPU.TableFormatting 0`), `stat SceneRendering`.
- Status bar Trace widget > Unreal Insights; `trace.enable counters,vsm`; CSV `CsvCategory VSM enable` then `csvprofile start` / `stop`.
- Viewport > Scalability menu (Performance and Scalability) for quick level switches; device profiles for the real contract.
