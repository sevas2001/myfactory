# Unreal Engine Expert Skills

Agent skills that let Claude (Claude Code) or Codex drive Unreal Engine 5.8 the way the experts in the best tutorials, conference talks and official documentation do. Built on 2026-09-24 with the same method as [Blender Expert Skills](../../dcc/blender/README.md), [Maya Expert Skills](../../dcc/maya/README.md) and [ZBrush Expert Skills](../../dcc/zbrush/README.md): transcripts of top-rated videos, cited expert notes, then skills with tools and review rubrics, graded blind against the same model without them. Start with the lead skill, `scenario-unreal-expert`.

## Status

- 10 skills (the lead `scenario-unreal-expert` and nine specialists) written from 115 expert videos (77 h) and 82 official documentation pages, each with references and an offline-tested `ue_<domain>.py` module. The lead carries the shared toolkit (`ue_env`, `ue_run`, `ue_remote`, `ue_review`, `ue_audit`, `ue_stat`).
- Blind-graded written scenarios (round 1): 51 % without the skills, 95 % with them (69/135 vs 128/135); all 9 scenarios improved. One grader per scenario: a direction, not a statistic. These scores were measured before the refactor included here; round 2 is planned after the first run in Unreal.
- Not verified inside Unreal Engine: the engine was not installed when these skills were built (Epic sign-in pending), so nothing has run in the engine. 1,534 offline checks pass across the 10 modules, with system Python and fake `unreal` modules only. Every Unreal API name, cvar and command in the skills is marked "not yet run in Unreal"; C++ builds and the MCP toolsets are untested. Treat the in-engine code paths as unverified until a first live run (`tests/OPEN_ISSUES.md` in the build project).

## Requirements

Unreal Engine 5.8 on macOS Apple Silicon. The lead skill `scenario-unreal-expert` explains the execution channels: Epic's experimental Unreal MCP server, Editor Python in a running editor (Python Remote Execution), headless `UnrealEditor-Cmd -run=pythonscript` jobs, the Remote Control API, console commands, commandlets and UAT. The offline layers of the modules run with system Python 3.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill scenario-unreal-expert --skill scenario-unreal-animation --skill scenario-unreal-cinematics --skill scenario-unreal-gameplay --skill scenario-unreal-lighting-rendering --skill scenario-unreal-materials --skill scenario-unreal-performance --skill scenario-unreal-pipeline-automation --skill scenario-unreal-vfx --skill scenario-unreal-world-building
```

The installer puts the skills side by side, which the specialists need: they import the lead skill's `scripts/`. In the installer picker (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills`), the family is the "Expert tools: Unreal Engine" group. Update with `npx skills update`.

## Provenance

Ported from [edemaistre/unreal-expert-skills](https://github.com/edemaistre/unreal-expert-skills/tree/v0.1), built on 2026-09-24, with these changes: the `scenario-` prefix on every skill name, this repository's frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`), no version line in the skill bodies, the sibling-install line in each `SKILL.md`, and paths into the build project made relative.

Mentions of v0.1, v0.2, v1 or v2 inside the references and code comments name the internal drafts of 2026-09-24.

Paths such as `tests/code/...`, `notes/...`, `sources/...` inside the skills point to the build project (tests, notes, sources) on the author's machine; they are provenance only.
