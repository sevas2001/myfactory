"""
ue_gameplay.py: toolkit of the scenario-unreal-gameplay skill (UE 5.8, macOS Apple Silicon).

Two layers in one file.

1. OFFLINE layer (system python3, stdlib only). Architecture decisions with their deciding
   conditions (where data lives, Blueprint vs C++, GAS or not, StateTree vs Behavior Tree vs
   Mass, ASC placement and replication mode), ini and gameplay-tag edits with backups, the
   Enhanced Input plan and its checks, C++ scaffolds (templates in ue_gameplay_cpp.py), the
   Build.cs patch and build command, a C++ lint for the experts' rules, analysis of PIE traces
   (jump apex, dash distance, cooldown, AI phases, state sequences, health bar), dumpticks
   parsing and tick verdicts, hard-reference verdicts, Blueprint snapshot scanning, Python
   automation-test generation, and the handoff contracts for scenario-unreal-vfx and scenario-unreal-performance.
   Tested by tests/code/unreal-gameplay/test_gameplay_offline.py (passed offline).

2. IN-EDITOR layer (Editor Python in UnrealEditor 5.8, `import unreal`). Probe, Blueprint
   children and CDO defaults, component defaults, Enhanced Input assets, gameplay tags and
   Gameplay Effects, ability children, StateTree assets, Widget Blueprint trees, data tables,
   a PIE scenario runner that injects input with Input.+key / Input.-key and samples the
   world every tick, and a gameplay asset audit.
   STATUS: NOT YET RUN IN UNREAL (engine not installed on 2026-09-24). Names marked [verify]
   are tried defensively; a failed attempt is reported, never silently skipped.

Shared toolkit (<skills>/scenario-unreal-expert/scripts, lead agent): ue_run.run_python / result /
args for headless and latent jobs, ue_review.screenshot / image_checks for captures,
ue_env.enable_plugins / find_engine / xcode_status, ue_stat for stat logs. Not reimplemented.

No em dashes in this file (project rule).
