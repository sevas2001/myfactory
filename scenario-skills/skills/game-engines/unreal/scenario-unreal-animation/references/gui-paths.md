# scenario-unreal-animation: GUI paths (for a computer-use agent)

Menu names from the 5.8 docs and expert videos; Mac shortcuts often use Cmd where the docs say Ctrl [verify]. Unreal 5.8 editors: Skeletal Mesh editor (not "Persona"), Physics Asset editor (not "PhAT").

## Import

- Content Browser > Import (or drag and drop) > **Interchange Pipeline Configuration** window: Choose Pipeline Stack, Basic Layout or Filter on Contents, Preview, Show Conflict, Import. Reimport remembers the stack.
- Pipeline stacks: Project Settings > Engine > **Interchange** (Import Content, Import Into Level, Editor Interface, Generic). Default pipeline assets: Engine > Plugins > Interchange Framework Content > Pipelines (enable Show Engine Content).
- Project-wide import defaults for gameplay clips: put the project's pipeline copy (Do not import curves with 0 values, Use 30Hz to Bake Bone Animation or Custom Bone Animation Sample Rate) in the Import Content stack; per-property defaults, visibility and read-only can be set in the pipeline asset. Legacy importer: config file (procedures P1).
- Extra LODs: Skeletal Mesh editor > LOD Settings > LOD Import.
- Root motion on a clip: Anim Sequence editor > Asset Details > Root Motion (Enable Root Motion, Root Motion Root Lock, Force Root Lock). Preview: Character > Animation > Root Motion (Ignore, Loop, Loop and Reset); Character > Bones > Bone Drawing > All Hierarchy (root in red).
- Compression: Anim Sequence Asset Details > Compression; settings asset toolbar > **Compress** after editing a codec.

## Skeleton and skin

- Skeletal Mesh editor: select a vertex to read its influences; Skin and Mesh tools (Skeletal Editor, production ready) with 5.8 weight locks (lock icon per bone), mirror strings, **Bone Count Reduction** (removes bones with no skin weights, keeps parents up to root), morph target editing.
- Project Settings > Engine > Rendering: Use Unlimited Bone Influences (threshold), Support 16-Bit Bone Index; mesh: Use High Precision Skin Weights.
- Skeleton asset > Retarget Manager area: Compatible Skeletons, translation retargeting modes (5.6: inherit from compatible skeleton checkbox).

## IK Rig

- Content Browser > Add > Animation > IK Rig > **IK Rig**. Toolbar **Auto Create Retarget Chains** and auto FBIK; Hierarchy: right-click a bone > **Set Pelvis**; select bones > right-click > New Retarget Chain; IK Retargeting panel > Add New Chain (+). Drag goals in the viewport to preview the solver.

## IK Retargeter

- Content Browser > Add > Animation > IK Rig > **IK Retargeter** (choose the source IK Rig). Or right-click any animation > **Retarget Animations** (auto retarget dialog with preview; exported retargeters have IK off).
- Layout: **Op Stack** top left, **Asset Browser** bottom left, Details right; toolbar **Run Retarget**, Add Default Ops, **Override Sets** and **Variables** buttons.
- Retarget pose: toolbar Edit Retarget Pose > Create (+) > Create (new pose), Edit Mode, Auto Align (Align All Bones, Selected, Selected and Children), **Snap Character to Ground**, Import from Animation Sequence or Pose Asset, Retarget Pose Blend slider.
- Chain map inside each chain op: Map All (Exact) / Map All (Fuzzy) / Map Only Empty.
- Run IK Rig sub-ops: Blend to Source, Offset Goals, Scale Goals, Floor Constraint (Foot Settings: Use Foot, Use Toes), Speed Plant, Stride Warp. Asset Settings: Profile Ops, per-op LOD thresholds, Ignore Root Lock in Preview, ExportRootLockMode.
- Op Stack > add op: **Pin Bones** (one row per bone: the IK helper bone to pin and the bone it follows, source or target skeleton, Copy Local Position with relative scale for props; field names [verify]); **Additive Pose** (pick or author the corrective pose, weight 0 to 1, drag it where it acts in the stack).
- Retarget Output Log: Window > Retarget Output Log; swap preview meshes and read it before any export.
- Export: Asset Browser > select > **Export Selected Animations** (folder, prefix, suffix, search and replace; Override Set to Apply). Output: Window > Retarget Output Log.

## Motion matching and GASP

- Plugins: Edit > Plugins > Animation > Pose Search (and Chooser, Animation Warping, Motion Warping), restart.
- Content Browser > Add > Animation > Motion Matching > **Pose Search Schema** / **Pose Search Database**. Database editor: Asset List (+), **Asset Browser** panel (drag clips), Selection Details, preview; right-click a clip to disable instead of deleting.
- AnimGraph: Motion Matching node (Searchable pin), Pose History (Generate Trajectory), Collected Bones; double-click the Motion Matching node for its **blend stack graph** (orientation warping, steering).
- Schema editor (after duplicating GASP's): schema skeleton (and its mirror data table) set to the target skeleton; each channel's Bone field (Pose channel `foot_l`/`foot_r`, Position and Heading channels, group sub-channels) remapped to the target's bones. Pose History node Details: the bones it samples (GASP: feet, thighs, spine, pelvis) remapped too.
- Offset Root Bone node Details: translation mode (Interpolate, Release), rotation mode (Accumulate, Release), radius, half-life; GASP binds them to functions per movement state (Get_OffsetRootTranslationHalfLife and siblings). Steering node: desired facing input, enabled only when moving or in air. Order: steering feeds the offset root bone.
- GASP widget > Anim Nodes toggles (Root Offset, Orientation Warping, Leg IK) with their debug renders, to judge each layer.
- Motion Matching node Details: Should Filter Notifies, Notify Recency Time Out, Blend Time, Max Active Blends, Store Blended Pose, Search Throttle Time, Pose Jump Threshold Time, Pose Reselect History.
- Chooser editor: open `CHT_PoseSearchDatabases` (GASP: Content/Characters/UEFN_Mannequin/Animations/MotionMatchingData/), add nested choosers and rows.
- Debug: Tools > Debug > **Rewind Debugger** and **Rewind Debugger Details**; options auto-record on PIE and auto-eject; pick the character (eyedropper), expand the AnimBP track > Pose Search track; Active Pose, Continuing Pose, Pose Candidates, **Channel Breakdown**; Ctrl+A selects all candidates. 5.6+: Trajectories dropdown > export for animators (record the tuned capsule first; earlier versions: Take Recorder).
- Movement model: character Blueprint > Character Movement component Details: walk speed per gait, acceleration, braking deceleration, friction (names [verify]); GASP sets gait speeds in the character Blueprint.
- GASP runtime retarget: `ABP_GenericRetarget` > IKRetargeter_Map add `RTG_UEFN_to_{asset}`; child Blueprint of `CBP_Sandbox_Character`, hide CharacterMesh, add a child Skeletal Mesh component with the retarget AnimBP and Component Tag `RTG_UEFN_to_{asset}`; Game Animation Widget buttons (timescale, still camera, database LOD, character override, debug draws).

- Preview scene for rigging: Show Environment off, Show Floor off, Exposure Metering Manual, Exposure Compensation 11.

## Sequencer (animator work)

- Mode dropdown > **Animation** mode: Constraints tab (5.7 merged Constraints, Space Switching, Snapper), Animation Layers, selection sets, Anim Details.
- Track (+) > Control Rig > Layered, pick the rig; Time Warp track; Curve Editor right-click > Filter > Bake (interval), key right-click > Interpolation > Constant (5.8.0: hotkeys do not work on the time warp curve).
- Character track right-click > **Bake To Control Rig** (rigs with a Backwards Solve only); right-click > **Configure AutoBake**, flame icon to toggle baked and live (5.8); Simple View Ctrl+Backspace [verify Mac].
- Constraint rules: create at the start frame; Active key to disable (X deletes); retime by deleting and re-keying; shift constrained keys from the timeline, not the section panel.
- Ground alignment: add a second Control Rig track `CR_GroundAlignment` on the mannequin.

## MetaHuman, ML Deformer, cloth

Skeletal Mesh Component > Mesh Deformer must carry the same Deformer Graph.
- Panel cloth: Content Browser > Add > cloth asset [verify menu] opens the Dataflow graph and 2D panel view; right-click a node > copy interactor name for Blueprint runtime tweaks. Legacy: Skeletal Mesh editor > Section Selection > Create Cloth Asset from Selection > Apply; Window > Clothing > Activate Cloth Paint.
