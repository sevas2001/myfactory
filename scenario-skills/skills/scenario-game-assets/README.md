# Maintaining the template references

The isometric and sprite-grid builders produce geometry independently of generative model availability. Tests cover neighbor edges, regions, headroom, cell coverage, guide placement, and reproducible output. The PNGs are build artifacts; the JSON manifests describe their placement. Sprite grids live with `scenario-sprite-animation`; a guide's upload does not establish that a generative model honors its alignment.

## Publication, Scenarians only

The runtime procedure is centralized in [the shared asset lifecycle](../scenario/references/shared-assets.md), linked directly from both template skills. It covers scope, reuse, staging, publication gaps, and public-access verification. Private upload receipts stay local. The public manifests acquire asset IDs only after access is verified.

Keep template geometry and lookup tags in the owning skill's JSON manifest. Run the builder and its regression suite together when changing it; a geometry or placement-contract change gets a new version. A staged guide is not evidence that a generative model obeys it: validate the intended map or sprite-sheet workflow separately.
