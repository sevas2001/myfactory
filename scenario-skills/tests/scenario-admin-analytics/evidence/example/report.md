## Coverage and interpretation

- Scope and dates match the MCP request; access is limited to the connected credential.
- Consumed CU is after discounts. Model CU measures generation activity; the difference from overall consumption is not allocated to models.
- CU and job counts measure usage, not productivity, ROI, seat activation, or time saved.
- Overall and identity consumption cover the original full period. Model filters apply to generation activity only.
- Per-user usage queries reconcile to every model's CU, API-key CU and job count.
