# Unattended scope planning check

Verdict: pass. A fresh agent received only the updated analytics skill, the connection skill, and the task below. It did not execute MCP calls or browse. The resulting plan was checked against the freshly fetched [tool reference](https://mcp.scenario.com/docs/tools) and [usage reference](https://mcp.scenario.com/docs/tools/usage).

## Task

A scheduled, non-interactive report requests the top three models by CU with job counts for the Design project, August 1 through August 31, 2026 UTC.

- Input A supplies no IDs. Prior discovery returned two projects with that name: Studio A (`team_example_a`, `project_example_a`) and Studio B (`team_example_b`, `project_example_b`). No human is available during the run.
- Input B explicitly supplies `team_id=team_example_b` and `project_id=project_example_b`.

All names and identifiers in this check are fictional. The tester was asked for the next actions and exact tool-call shapes, including whether analytics would be requested and why.

## Assessment

Input A stops and lists the choices without guessing or widening scope. Input B uses the explicit pair without waiting for confirmation. The plan uses valid discovery and usage parameters, includes both CU and jobs, applies inclusive UTC dates, and keeps the documented MCP fallback. No live data was collected.

## Tester plan

1. **Input A: stop without an analytics request.** The completed `teams_list` discovery found two matching projects, and the non-interactive task supplies no team/project ID pair. Issue no `usage` call and do not choose the first match, combine the projects, or widen the scope. Return the unresolved choices for the schedule owner to configure:
   - Studio A: `team_id="team_example_a"`, `project_id="project_example_a"`.
   - Studio B: `team_id="team_example_b"`, `project_id="project_example_b"`.
     No additional discovery is needed to establish the ambiguity already given in the task.

2. **Input B: use the explicit pair without waiting for human confirmation.** Select `team_id="team_example_b"` and `project_id="project_example_b"`. The task's explicit IDs resolve the unattended scope. Request project analytics for August 1 through August 31, 2026 UTC, with inclusive bounds. No prior snapshot is supplied by this test, so this plan obtains fresh data.

3. **Discover the current usage schema if missing or stale.** No live schema is provided in this planning exercise, so plan:

   ```javascript
   scenario_tools_search({ query: "usage", limit: 1 });
   ```

   This catalog search accepts only `query` and `limit`; do not add scope arguments to it. Inspect its schema and permission before the analytics call. Uncertainty: this test does not establish whether a current direct `usage` signature is available, so choose the following direct or catalog route according to that discovery. Do not execute both.

4. **Issue one project-scoped analytics request for input B.** If the current direct tool is available:

   ```javascript
   usage({
     team_id: "team_example_b",
     project_id: "project_example_b",
     scope: "project",
     start_date: "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",
     end_date: "2026-08-31T23:59:59.999Z",
     response_format: "json",
   });
   ```

   If catalog-only, or the host's direct signature is stale while the fresh catalog supports these fields:

   ```javascript
   scenario_tool_execute_read({
     name: "usage",
     parameters: {
       team_id: "team_example_b",
       project_id: "project_example_b",
       scope: "project",
       start_date: "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",
       end_date: "2026-08-31T23:59:59.999Z",
       response_format: "json",
     },
   });
   ```

   Use `parameters`, never `arguments`. Summary JSON provides `modelUsages` for this ranking; activity, time series, per-user queries, and broader project filters are unnecessary for the requested answer.

5. **Validate and rank the returned data locally.** Check echoed scope and dates against the selected project and exact UTC window. Check `consumption[].value` against `totals.totalCU`. Rank `modelUsages` by descending `totalCU`, break ties deterministically by the stable model ID returned by the response, and take at most three rows. Show each row's `totalCU` and `totalJobs`. Preserve decimals and signed values; do not subtract discounts again. Model CU measures generation activity and need not equal overall consumed CU. Withhold any affected attribution if its validation fails and report the exact mismatch. Uncertainty: the supplied documents do not specify the exact model identity/name field names or echo structure, so read those from the actual schema/response rather than inventing them.

6. **Return the bounded result.** State Studio B's selected Design project, August 1 through August 31, 2026 UTC, ranking by model CU, retrieval time, and a table containing the returned model identities, CU, and job counts. Jobs mean model executions, not successful assets. If fewer than three models are returned, show only those present; distinguish empty results from permission or connection failures. No results or model names can be supplied during this planning-only test, and no analytics calls have been executed.
