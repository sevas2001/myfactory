"""Doc surface lock for the recolor feature.

An external user who only reads the docs must be able to bake colourways. The
implementation is already covered by `test_recolor_bake` / `test_recolor_curation_view`;
this file only asserts that the hub and the leaf teach the same commands, that the
curation sidecar field is named, and that the changelog records the feature.
Internal project names and absolute personal paths must not appear in the new leaf
(open-source vocabulary rule for this repo).
