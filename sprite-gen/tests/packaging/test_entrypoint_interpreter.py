"""Deployment-interpreter contract for the agent-facing entrypoints.

The skill's dependencies (Pillow, NumPy) are declared in `pyproject.toml` and
materialized into the repo-root `.venv` — the same venv the README quickstart
and CI create. A global `python3` is whatever `$PATH` points at that day; on
macOS that is a PEP 668 externally-managed homebrew CPython whose packages were
installed by hand, so declaration and reality drift there (observed: Pillow
present, NumPy absent — one dependency installed made the surface *look*
provisioned).

Agent-facing docs (`SKILL.md`, `docs/*.md`) are read by agents in shells that
never activated the venv, so *every* invocation there must name the interpreter
explicitly — the absolute skill-path form and the repo-relative
`python3 scripts/<script>.py` form alike. The relative form is not safer: it was
the shape that actually drifted (`docs/frame-interpolation.md` carried
`python3 scripts/interpolate_frames.py` as its only command, with zero mentions
of `venv`/`activate` anywhere in the file, and that script imports
`sprite_gen.frames.extract` at module load).

Only the README quickstart register stays out of scope, and it is out of scope
by not being scanned at all: its relative examples follow an explicit
`source .venv/bin/activate` line that resolves to this same interpreter.
