"""The curation SPA ships inside the package, from one location.

`sprite-gen curation` finds its assets relative to `sprite_gen/serve/serve_curation.py`, so an
asset that `pyproject.toml` does not declare as package data is simply absent from an
installed wheel — the server still boots and still serves `index.html`, and every
`<script src>` in it 404s. Nothing fails at build time, so what lands in the build is
checked here against what is actually on disk instead.

Checked against the build, not against the declaration string: reading the patterns and
asking "does this asset look like one of them" is how the first version of this guard passed
while the wheel was already dropping files (`fnmatch`'s `*` crosses `/`, setuptools' does
not). Both tests below therefore go through an expansion that packaging actually performs —
`glob(recursive=True)` for the always-on one, a real wheel build for the other.

The same reasoning covers the subprocess routes (`/api/compose`, `/api/interpolate`,
`/api/reroll`, `/api/export`, `/api/export-gif`): naming `scripts/<tool>.py` there would
work in a checkout and 500 in an install, because the `scripts/` wrappers are not
installed. Those routes go through `-m sprite_gen.<module>`, and the last test holds them
to it.
