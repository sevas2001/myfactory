# `sprite-gen gen` — provider-backed image generation (engine SSoT)

> Owns: `sprite-gen gen` / `gen-set`: providers, default resolution, transparency strategy per provider, the billed knobs (`--quality`, `--resolution`), row usage · Index: [docs/README.md](README.md)

Generation is a first-class engine module (`sprite_gen/gen/`), not an external
skill. One call = a prompt (+ optional reference images) → one **verified** PNG on
disk, with an optional transparent output whose strategy is decided per provider
(native alpha or deterministic chroma keying). The general `image-gen` skill is a
thin shuttle over this command.

Providers are the backends the maintainer uses day to day. Others (Gemini,
OpenRouter, fal, BytePlus, …) are absent because nobody here uses them, not because
of a design objection; a contributed provider is welcome when its author will keep
maintaining it ([#37](https://github.com/aldegad/sprite-gen/issues/37)). A backend
whose terms forbid reaching a subscription login from third-party software is not
added, however it is invoked
([#36](https://github.com/aldegad/sprite-gen/pull/36), Antigravity).

| Provider | Backend | Auth | Billing | Output truth | Transparency strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` | codex `image_gen` | ChatGPT OAuth | your ChatGPT subscription | inline base64 in the session rollout jsonl, decoded deterministically | **`native`** — image_gen returns a real alpha channel when asked (measured, then published) |
| `grok` | direct Imagine `/images/generations` or `/images/edits` | Grok login (preferred) or `XAI_API_KEY` | your SuperGrok Imagine quota; console credit only on the key route | inline bytes decoded and re-encoded as a verified PNG | `chroma` — Imagine returns JPEG only; generate on a key and matte it out |
| `openai` | direct Images `/v1/images/generations` or `/v1/images/edits` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **billed per call** — for servers and SaaS | inline base64 decoded and published as a verified PNG | **`native`** — `background: transparent` returns a real alpha channel |

The strategy is declared **once**, on the adapter (`Provider.transparency`), and is
the only place that says what a backend can do. See
[Transparent output](#transparent-output--strategy-per-provider).

## Subscription first — `openai` is named or it does not run

`codex` and `grok` run on a subscription the user already pays for. `openai`
reaches the same family of GPT image models over the REST API with nothing but a
key — which is what a headless container (a Modal worker, CI, a SaaS backend) can
have, and where an interactive ChatGPT login cannot exist — and every call is
billed against that key. So it is registered, documented, and **explicit-only**
(maintainer 확정 2026-09-20):

- it runs only when `--provider openai` names it;
- `SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openai` is **refused**, not honoured;
- the guided flow (`sprite-gen workflow`) never offers it and never saves it as a
  preference;
- no availability fallback targets it — a codex outage reaches `grok`, another
  subscription route, or it fails; it never reaches metered credit;
- having `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment changes no route by itself;
- every call it does make prints one stderr line naming the charge *before* the
  request leaves.

If you are one person generating sprites, use `codex` or `grok`.

## Default provider selection

`--provider` is **optional**. When omitted, the backend is resolved by a fixed
precedence (maintainer 확정 2026-07-17):

1. **`SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`** env var (`codex` or `grok`) — the user override.
   An unknown value fails loud, and so does `openai`: a per-call API backend is
   named at the call site or not used ([subscription first](#subscription-first--openai-is-named-or-it-does-not-run)).
2. **`codex`** — the hard default (GPT `image_gen`).

If the resolved default is `codex` but codex is unavailable here (CLI not on PATH,
or `codex login status` reports not-logged-in), the resolution **falls back to
`grok` — observably, never silently**: a stderr notice is printed and the report
JSON records `provider_fallback` (`from`/`to`/`reason`/`default_source`). The
grok default (`SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=grok`) has no reverse fallback — a down
grok fails loud at generation time. The fallback target is a subscription route by
construction; `openai` is never one.

An **explicit `--provider`** is always honored verbatim — it is never overridden by
the availability fallback. An explicitly named provider that is down fails loud
(the provider adapter raises), preserving the operator's stated intent.

Every generation reports which backend actually ran: `provider` (the real
backend), `provider_resolved_from` (`explicit` / `SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` /
`hard-default` / `fallback-from-codex`), and `provider_fallback` when a fallback
happened.

## Direct Grok calls and authentication

`sprite-gen gen --provider grok` → `GrokProvider` → xAI Imagine API. The same
path works from any agent engine; no Grok Build subprocess is started.
The default is `grok-imagine-image-2.0`. `--model` selects an **image API model**,
not a Grok Build reasoning model.

Image and video calls share `sprite_gen/gen/xai.py` for credentials and JSON
transport. The user's Grok subscription login (`GROK_HOME` or `~/.grok`) takes
precedence even when `XAI_API_KEY` is set. Only an absent login file permits the
API key (console credits); an invalid, expired or rejected login never does. See
[authentication and expiry](video.md#setup--pick-one-credential)
for setup; the video modes (last-frame pin, references, `video-extend`, `video-edit`) are in [video.md](video.md#modes--which-flags-call-what). No Grok executable is needed during generation with a valid credential.
No agent, credential fallback or automatic retry is started on failure.

New images use `/v1/images/generations`; one reference uses `/v1/images/edits`
with `image`, two to five use `images` in input order. A single-reference edit
inherits its source aspect ratio; `--aspect-ratio` applies to generation and
multi-reference edits. Invalid reference files and more than five references
fail before upload. Base64 output is requested, decoded, and converted to a real
PNG without resizing before atomic publication. Missing or malformed image data
fails without replacing an existing raw output.

Image reports include `extra.auth_source`, `extra.transport: "xai-api"`,
`extra.endpoint`, and `extra.aspect_ratio_source`. Tokens, signed URLs and raw
API error bodies are not reported. Skipping the agent removes its startup and
reasoning overhead; speed and account-quota savings are not benchmarked guarantees.

API contracts: [image generation](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/images/generation),
[image editing](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/images/editing),
[multi-image editing](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/images/multi-image-editing).

## Direct OpenAI calls and authentication

`sprite-gen gen --provider openai` → `OpenAIProvider` → the OpenAI Images REST API.
No `codex` CLI, no browser sign-in, no subprocess: the whole credential is
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, read from the environment at call time and never written
anywhere. Unset, the run stops naming the variable and where to get a key; set but
empty, it says so. It never falls back to the codex ChatGPT login, to another key,
or to a retry — and see [subscription first](#subscription-first--openai-is-named-or-it-does-not-run)
for why nothing routes here on its own.

The default model is `gpt-image-2.5-flare`; `--model` selects another gpt-image
model. New images use `POST /v1/images/generations` (JSON); attaching `--ref` uses
`POST /v1/images/edits`, which takes **multipart/form-data** with the references as
repeated `image[]` parts in the order given (up to 16). A reference that is not a
readable PNG, JPEG or WebP fails before upload, and parts are named by position, not
by the local filename.

gpt-image models always answer with inline base64 (the API does not accept
`response_format`), so there is no signed URL to follow and no bearer token to
forward. The payload is decoded, verified as a PNG and published atomically without
resizing; a missing, malformed or multi-image response fails without replacing an
existing raw output. HTTP 401/403 names the credential; any other non-200 fails
with the status only — an error body can echo the prompt or a key, so it is not
printed.

`--aspect-ratio` picks the `size`. gpt-image has no long-edge preset, so the ratio
maps to one concrete size out of a table that satisfies the documented constraints
(both sides divisible by 16, ratio within 1:3..3:1, 655,360–8,294,400 pixels) and is
checked by the test suite: `1:1` 1024x1024, `3:2` 1536x1024, `2:3` 1024x1536, `4:3`
1024x768, `3:4` 768x1024, `16:9` 1536x864, `9:16` 864x1536, `2:1` 1440x720, `1:2`
720x1440, `3:1` 1536x512, `1:3` 512x1536, plus `auto`. Omitted = 1024x1024. A ratio
with no exact gpt-image size (`19.5:9`, say) is refused rather than rounded to a
nearby one you would be billed for.

`--transparent` asks for `background: transparent` with `output_format: png` —
genuine alpha, the same `native` strategy as codex, and the same measurement gate
afterwards. Measured 2026-09-20 on `gpt-image-2.5-flare` at `--quality low`: 84 % of
the frame at alpha 0, the subject itself at alpha 251–254 (so `partial_alpha_pct`
covers the body, exactly as codex `image_gen` does — downstream extraction treats
`alpha ≤ 16` as transparent, so this is usable as-is).

Image reports include `extra.auth_source`, `extra.transport: "openai-api"`,
`extra.endpoint`, `extra.quality`, `extra.size`, `extra.background` and, when the
API returns it, `extra.usage` (token counts only — what the call cost, never what it
contained).

API contract: [OpenAI Images](https://developers.openai.com/api/images/) (field names
and enums confirmed there 2026-09-20).

## CLI

```bash
sprite-gen gen \
  [--provider codex|grok|openai] # optional; default = SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER env → codex (observable grok fallback if codex is down). openai only when named here — it bills per call
  --prompt "…"            # or --prompt-file PROMPT.txt
  --out DEST.png \
  [--ref REF.png ...]     # repeatable; Grok accepts up to five references, openai up to sixteen
  [--transparent [--alpha-mode auto|native|chroma] [--chroma-key magenta|green]] \
  [--white-check CHECK.png] \
  [--aspect-ratio 1:1]    # grok and openai, e.g. 1:1 or 16:9; grok single-ref edits inherit the source ratio; openai maps it to a gpt-image size
  [--quality low|medium|high|xhigh|max|auto] # billed effort; openai takes the range, grok takes auto/low/medium
  [--resolution 1k|1.5k|2k]  # grok output-size tier, priced with --quality
  [--model ID] \
  [--report REPORT.json] \
  [--keep-session]        # codex: keep the rollout jsonl instead of deleting it
```

Backward-compatible wrapper: `$SPRITE_GEN_ROOT/.venv/bin/python $SPRITE_GEN_ROOT/scripts/generate_sprite_image.py …` (same args).

- **Non-transparent**: the raw PNG (background included) is copied to `--out`.
- **`--transparent`**: publishes a clean RGBA PNG using the provider's transparency
  strategy (below). Either way a result with no transparent area, or any transparent
  pixel that still carries non-zero RGB, **fails loudly before the output or success
  report is published** (No Silent Fallback).
- The pre-process raw is preserved next to the destination as `<out>.raw.png` for audit.
- `--report` writes a `sprite-gen-image-report` JSON: provider, prompt, out/raw paths,
  `raw_bytes`, `elapsed_seconds`, `session_id` (codex), an `alpha` block
  (`strategy` + the measured stats), the `chroma` stats when chroma keying ran, and the
  provider-resolution fields (`provider_resolved_from`, and `provider_fallback` when a
  codex→grok default fallback occurred), plus the provider `extra` block
  (`auth_source`, `transport`, `endpoint`, and the knobs the request actually
  carried).

## `--quality` and `--resolution` — the two billed knobs

They are one shared vocabulary; what a backend can honour is a per-provider
capability, declared in its adapter:

| Provider | `--quality` | `--resolution` |
|---|---|---|
| `codex` | refused — `image_gen` exposes no effort dial | refused |
| `grok` | `auto` `low` `medium` | `1k` `1.5k` `2k` |
| `openai` | `auto` `low` `medium` `high` `xhigh` `max` | refused — a gpt-image `size` comes from `--aspect-ratio` |

- **Omitted = the provider's own default.** The request body is then byte-identical
  to what the same call already sent, so nothing about existing runs changes.
- **A level a provider cannot honour fails before the call.** It is never dropped
  from a body you are about to pay for, and never downgraded to whatever the
  backend felt like returning (No Silent Fallback). "Refused" above is a loud error
  naming the flag, not a silently ignored argument.
- **grok prices an image on the pair**, so `2k` + `medium` costs more than `1k` +
  `low`. The resolution names are **tiers, not pixel counts**: the service decides
  the pixels, and `1.5k` came back 1408x1408 at `--aspect-ratio 1:1` (실측
  2026-09-20) — not 1536, and not 1024. Nothing here derives a size from the name.
- The grok subsets were read off the server, not off the prose (2026-09-20 probes):
  `quality` deserializes the wider shared enum and *then* refuses per model
  (`high` → HTTP 400 "This model only supports the following quality value(s):
  low, medium, auto."), `resolution: 1.5k` renders (HTTP 200) although the
  capability guide's prose lists only 1k and 2k, and an **unknown field is not
  refused at all** — a probe carrying one rendered normally. That last one is why
  these names are checked locally instead of being left to the service to notice.
- Every call that spends API credit rather than a subscription prints the knobs it
  is being billed on in the same stderr line as the charge.

## Transparent output — strategy per provider

`--transparent` does not mean "chroma key" any more. Each adapter declares the one
strategy it can execute, and `--alpha-mode auto` (the default) follows it:

| Strategy | Who | What happens | Refused when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `native` | `codex` (**first choice**, 2026-09-08), `openai` (`background: transparent`) | On codex the transport prompt asks image_gen for a genuinely transparent background (the bundled `imagegen` skill honours "transparent background" and keeps the generated alpha; codex reports `transparentBackground: true` on the completed item); on openai the request carries `background: transparent` with `output_format: png`, which the API answers with a real alpha channel. Either way the decoded PNG's alpha is **measured**: no alpha band or `alpha_zero_pct: 0.0` refuses to publish, RGB under alpha 0 is scrubbed, partial alpha (1–254) is left as produced and reported as `partial_alpha_pct`. | The model drew a checkerboard / flat background (RGB image) — nothing can recover alpha from that, so the run fails instead of silently keying. |
| `chroma` | `grok` (only option), `codex` with `--alpha-mode chroma` | Generate on a `#FF00FF` (or `#00FF00`) background — pick the key by subject colour (magenta subjects → green key) — and matte it out through the frame extractor's canonical YCbCr matte (`remove_chroma_background_ycbcr`), which keys from the background chroma it detects on the borders (`detect_background_key_ycc`) rather than from the pure key alone — the RGB matte behind `cutout`/`extract`/`slice-sheet` does the same since 2026-09-11 (`detect_background_key_rgb`), so every chroma path tolerates the slightly-off green/magenta generators actually paint. Gradients and texture within that chroma family are supported. | `alpha_zero_pct: 0.0` after keying, or stale RGB under alpha 0. |

- **`auto` steps down to `chroma` when `--ref` is attached**, on either native provider. Measured
  2026-09-08 (plan `sprite-gen/parts-rig`): codex `image_gen` with reference images
  returned real alpha in 1/6 runs and drew a checkerboard (RGB) in 5/6, while the same
  prompts on a `#00FF00` key + chroma keying succeeded 6/6. The decision is made before
  the model runs, printed to stderr, and recorded as `alpha.strategy_source:
  "refs-attached"` (`provider-default` / `explicit` otherwise). The measurement is
  codex's; openai's edit path is not separately measured and inherits the same
  conservative default. `--alpha-mode native`
  still forces native alpha with refs — and fails loud on an RGB result. So a ref run's
  prompt must carry the chroma key, exactly as the sprite-row pipeline already does.
- `--alpha-mode chroma` on codex is for prompts that already carry a key background
  (the sprite-row pipeline today): the native request is **not** added to the prompt
  and the raw is keyed like a grok run.
- `--alpha-mode native` on a `chroma`-only provider **fails loud before any model
  call** — a strategy the backend cannot execute is not a fallback candidate, and
  native → chroma never happens silently either (the prompt shapes are different).
- Why grok is chroma-only: Grok Imagine Image 2.0 returns `image/jpeg` from both the
  `/v1/images/*` API and the CLI `image_gen`/`image_edit` tools, and the official
  docs expose no background parameter — its "background removal" is a consumer-app
  tool (4/4 drawn checkerboards on 2026-09-08). The declaration lives in
  `sprite_gen/gen/grok_provider.py` and flips only with a new measurement.
- Measured codex output (2026-09-08, codex 0.153.4): `alpha_zero_pct ≈ 62`, body alpha
  ≈ 253 (so `partial_alpha_pct` is most of the subject), a ~1 px light fringe on a
  magenta composite. Downstream extraction treats `alpha ≤ 16` as transparent, so
  this is usable as-is; alpha snapping is deliberately not applied here.

## How each provider works

- **codex** — spawns a fresh `codex exec --json` in an empty sandbox
  (`--sandbox workspace-write`, `--add-dir <Codex state root>/generated_images`,
  `--skip-git-repo-check`, no `--ephemeral`). A fresh session breaks OpenAI's prompt
  cache so repeat prompts don't drag in a prior image. The session id comes from the
  `thread.started` event (older codex: a `session id:` text line — both supported); the
  inline base64 is decoded from the rollout jsonl (`image_generation_call` /
  `image_generation_end` records — both supported). The model-reported path is never
  trusted. The rollout jsonl (which holds the ~1–1.5 MB inline image) is deleted after
  extraction unless `--keep-session`.
  The adapter and child process share one Codex state root: when `CODEX_HOME` is set they use only that directory; when it is unset they use Codex's `~/.codex` default.
  Rollouts are selected by an exact session-id filename suffix.
  Missing, duplicate, or pre-existing stale matches fail rather than falling back to another root or choosing by modification time.
  The transport prompt names the skill with codex's official `$imagegen` mention, which is how a codex skill is invoked explicitly. The adapter owns that trigger alone; the caller's sprite-request prompt is passed through verbatim.

### When codex produces no image at all

A run that reaches a rollout but finds zero `image_generation_call` /
`image_generation_end` records means the built-in `image_gen` tool was never
offered to the session, not that the model declined to use it. Built-in image
generation is a **capability of the account behind the active Codex state root**.

A session that is not offered the tool cannot be talked into it. The `$imagegen`
mention names the skill, it does not create the tool; the model choice does not
change it; and no `config.toml` feature toggle grants it. The remedy is to point
`CODEX_HOME` at a Codex state root whose account provides image generation
(`codex login status`), or to use `--provider grok`. The adapter fails loudly with
exactly that, rather than falling back on its own.
- **grok** — uses the [direct API contract](#direct-grok-calls-and-authentication) above.
- **openai** — uses the [direct API contract](#direct-openai-calls-and-authentication)
  above: one HTTPS request on `OPENAI_API_KEY`, no CLI and no subprocess, which is
  the whole reason it exists (a container has a key, not a browser). Explicit-only,
  and billed per call.

## Sprite-row usage

In the atlas pipeline (SKILL.md §2) the rows of a prepared run are generated by
`sprite-gen gen-set --run-dir <run>`: every non-mirrored state, `--concurrency` 6 at a
time (lead-verified: no provider throttling at 6), each row with the identity ref the run declares (`base-source.*`, or the accepted
direction anchor for a direction-contract action row — `sprite_gen.curate.anchor` owns
that choice) plus its layout guide, into `raw/<state>.png`. Each row gets
`reports/gen-set/<state>.json`, the batch writes `reports/gen-set/table.md` and
`set.report.json`, existing rows are reused unless `--force`, a direction run generates
its anchors before its rows and stops when an anchor failed, and the exit code is
non-zero when any row failed. `--provider` is honoured verbatim; unspecified, it
resolves exactly as `gen` does (above), and any codex→grok availability failover is
recorded per row.

One row by hand is the same call `gen-set` makes: `--provider codex` (or `grok`) with
`prompts/<state>.txt`, writing `raw/<state>.png`.
The row prompts still carry the request chroma key on the background and frame
extraction removes it downstream — rows are generated **without** `--transparent`, so
the native strategy does not apply to them yet (moving rows to native alpha is a
separate, measured change).
The correction loop (`sprite-gen correction-loop --provider-command …`) can drive this
`gen` command as its regeneration step so inspect → score → hint → regenerate closes
against a real provider.

## Speed

On a 4-frame idle mushroom row, grok generated
in ~18.4 s vs codex ~39.0 s (~2.1× faster). codex adhered better to negative constraints
("no grid lines"); grok added faint cell dividers. Pick per need: grok for speed, codex
for tighter prompt adherence.

## `--trim-alpha` — the bottom edge is the foot line

A generated transparent still carries an unpredictable band of empty alpha under the
feet and around the sides; two stills placed on the same floor line then stand at
different heights, and a still swapped for a strip cell (whose feet sit on the cell
bottom) jumps. `--trim-alpha` (only with `--transparent`) crops the published PNG to the
bbox of its opaque pixels (alpha ≥ 8) after the transparency step, so the image's bottom
edge *is* the ground-contact line. The subject is never cut — only fully transparent
margin goes — and the report records `extra.trim_alpha` with the `bbox`, `before` /
`after` sizes and the `margin_px` removed on each side. The `.raw.png` beside the output
is untouched.
