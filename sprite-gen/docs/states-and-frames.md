## Simple MVP Scope

The default user promise is deliberately simple:

> A Codex user installs this skill, provides a character/base image and one or more simple actions, then receives a sprite sheet, GIF preview, and QA notes.

Do not frame the default path as game-ready humanoid locomotion. The current Codex/image-gen path is good at short readable pose changes, identity-preserving rows, chroma cleanup, atlas composition, and QA. It is not yet reliable enough to promise precise cyclic locomotion for humanoids.

Default/simple states:

- `idle` — stable default. Use 4 frames, loop true.
- `jump` — stable default as a short non-loop action. Use 4 frames, loop false.
- `attack` — stable default as a short non-loop action. Use 4 frames, loop false.
- `wave` — simple gesture, but only stable as non-loop unless the row includes a return-to-idle frame. Use 4 frames, loop false by default; use 5 frames only when the final frame intentionally returns near frame 1.
- `talk`, `blink`, `bounce`, `hurt`, `celebrate`, `magic_cast` — allowed simple candidates, but still require motion QA before pass.

Experimental states:

- `walk`, `run`, `frontwalk`, `45_frontwalk`, and other cyclic locomotion.
- Directional cycles that require exact foot-contact alternation or phase symmetry.
- Any state where the user needs game-ready locomotion rather than a readable preview animation.

For experimental states, report them as experimental in `qa-notes.md` unless motion QA passes. Never silently promote a weak walk/run row to the same status as simple MVP output.

## Quick Path For Simple Animations

When the user asks for "simple sprite animation", prefer this request shape unless they specify otherwise:

```json
{
  "states": {
    "idle": { "frames": 4, "fps": 4, "loop": true, "action": "subtle breathing and one blink" },
    "attack": { "frames": 4, "fps": 8, "loop": false, "action": "simple windup, strike, recovery attack pose sequence with no detached effects" },
    "jump": { "frames": 4, "fps": 8, "loop": false, "action": "simple jump arc: crouch, takeoff, airborne, landing" }
  }
}
```

Add `wave` only as a non-loop gesture by default:

```json
"wave": { "frames": 4, "fps": 6, "loop": false, "action": "friendly hand wave gesture; arm changes clearly while feet stay planted" }
```

Simple MVP pass requires:

- automated extraction and atlas reports pass
- `qa/<state>.gif` reads as the requested simple action
- loop seam passes for looped states
- non-loop states have clear start/middle/end pose progression
- `qa-notes.md` records `pass`, `best-effort`, or `experimental` per state

## Frame Count Guidance

Keep default simple actions short. More frames do not automatically create smoother animation in the current component-row image generation path:

- `4` frames is the default stable range for simple actions.
- `5` frames is acceptable when a non-loop gesture needs a return-to-idle pose.
- `6` frames is the conservative upper edge for simple humanoid one-shot defaults.
- `8` frames is hatch-pet-style advanced territory, not forbidden. Use it for compact mascots, locomotion rows, or explicit experiments only when extraction/motion QA passes.
- `9` and `12` frames are **not** default simple settings. In validation runs, they increased duplicate bodies, empty/sparse frames, slot collapse, and extraction failure before adding useful in-betweens.

If a user asks for 9 or 12 frames, run it as an explicit experiment and report `duplicate-heavy`, `blur/merge`, or `extract-fail` honestly instead of treating it as a normal pass.
