"""Direct Grok Imagine image generation/editing, with no Grok Build process.

`quality` and `resolution` are the two knobs Imagine prices an image on
(docs.x.ai, 2026-09-20 확인): quality for grok-imagine-image-2.0 only, resolution
naming an output-size tier (a tier, not a pixel count — `1.5k` rendered 1408x1408
at 1:1). Both are sent only when the caller asks for one, so a request that names
neither stays exactly what it was.

# finer belongs to another backend, so it is refused here rather than billed as
# whatever the service picked. Omitted = `auto`, which the service resolves to
# low for generations and medium for edits.
#
# Both sets were read off the server, not the prose (2026-09-20 probes on the
# subscription route). Deserialization alone is not the answer: `quality` accepts
# `high` into the shared enum and then refuses it per model —
#   HTTP 400 "This model only supports the following quality value(s): low,
#   medium, auto."
# — so `high` is refused here instead of costing a round-trip. `resolution` 1.5k
# is served (HTTP 200) although the capability guide's prose lists only 1k and 2k;
# the REST schema enum has all three. An unknown field is not refused at all (a
# probe carrying one rendered normally), which is exactly why these names are
# checked here rather than left to the service to notice.
