"""Subject profile — resolution-aware sparse-frame validation defaults.

The sparse-frame floor exists to catch empty frames and extraction debris.
"How many opaque pixels count as debris" is a property of the *subject*, not
of arithmetic: a character is expected to occupy more pixels than an effect,
but neither expectation is an absolute number independent of resolution.

`sprite-request.json` declares `"subject": "character" | "effect"`; no field
means character. The floor is derived from the cell geometry:

    equivalent_side = ceil(sqrt(width * height))
    character floor = equivalent_side
    effect floor    = ceil(equivalent_side / 2)

The geometric mean extends the same rule to rectangular cells without picking
one axis as truth. It deliberately uses the declared cell rather than safe
margins: integer margin rounding can grow by two pixels when a cell grows by
one, which would make a supposedly resolution-scaled floor decrease. Scaling a
cell by k scales the floor by k, not k². An explicit `--min-used-pixels` always
wins.
