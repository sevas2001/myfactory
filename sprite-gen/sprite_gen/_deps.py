"""The one module that imports NumPy — and the one place its absence is reported.

NumPy is a declared runtime dependency (`pyproject.toml`), materialized by the
repo-root `.venv` that README quickstart and CI build. An interpreter without it
is not a degraded environment this package works around: the extraction path
carries a byte-identity contract, so a second implementation of the same pixel
math would be two answers to one question (principle 6). There is therefore no
pure-Python fallback, and there is no `numpy = None` sentinel for callers to
branch on — importing this module either yields NumPy or raises.

A bare `import numpy` would already fail loudly, but `No module named 'numpy'`
tells an agent nothing about *which* interpreter it just used or how to get a
working one, and that is the failure this repo actually hit (homebrew `python3`
carried Pillow but not NumPy, so the surface looked provisioned). This module
re-raises with the interpreter it ran under and the exact install command.

Every other shipped module reaches NumPy through here, by importing `np` from
this module, and `sprite_gen/__init__.py` imports this module, so the gate fires
at package import — before any entrypoint gets far enough to do partial work.
`tests/test_numpy_dependency_gate.py` locks both halves.
